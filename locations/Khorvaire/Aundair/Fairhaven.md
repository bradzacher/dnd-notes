The capital of Aundair is one of the most beautiful cities in Eberron. Stunning displays of magical light and other arcane wonders enhance the exquisite architecture. This is the seat of the University of Wynarn, a prestigious institution that draws students from across Khorvaire. As a noble, entertainer, or sage, you might have your roots in the City of Lights.
