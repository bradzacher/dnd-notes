# Stormhome

This island city is the seat of House Lyrandar, and Queen Aurala allows the house a free rein in governing the isle. It is the finest resort and vacation spot in Khorvaire. Spies, charlatans, sailors, and house agents all have a place in Stormhome. Even though the island escaped the devastation wrought during the Last War, it remains a hotbed for clandestine activities.

Lyrandar wizards use magic to continuously alter Stormhome's weather, turning the otherwise bleak and storm-blasted location into a temperate island getaway.
