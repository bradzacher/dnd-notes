# The Crying Fields

The Crying Fields are a region of land to the east of Ghalt, a town in Aundair. It is located near the Thrane border. During the Last War, the Crying Fields were the site of five battles between Thrane and Aundair, as Thrane troops would often attempt to use the fields to avoid Towers Valiant and Vigilant. Aundair was eventually victorious, with the region passing into their control.

The fields display signs of some sort of haunting or curse, for since the battles the grass that grows here has become a bloody crimson red. The sounds of battle can be heard from out of the fog, quietly during the day and louder at night, with the loudest nights occurring once per month, on the night that the month's dominant moon is full. On these nights it is said that undead soldiers rise to walk the plains. Not only that, but trenches, walls and other fortifications magically appear in the fields on these nights, though they are jumbled by the overlapping memories of five distinct battles. The region is thoroughly abandoned by the living. Despite what one might expect, the name comes not from the tragedies that occurred here but from an odd weather pattern in the region. When the wind is right, it blows across Lake Galifar and creates a sound of anguished crying. Whether this is a natural phenomenon or linked to the alleged hauntings is unclear.
