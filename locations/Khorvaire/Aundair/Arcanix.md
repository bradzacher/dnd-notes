# Arcanix

This farming village on Lake Galifar provides food for the nearby floating towers of wizardry that serve as home to Aundair's Arcane Congressâ€”a cutting-edge research facility and the finest school of magic in Khorvaire. The members of the congress oversee the magical research conducted in these towers, advise Aundair's queen on all things magical, and confer with colleagues visiting from other nations.

Apprentices come from all over Khorvaire to train at Arcanix. If you're a wizard, sage, or artificer, you might have learned your craft here.
