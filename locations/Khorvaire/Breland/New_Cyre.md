# New Cyre

What began as a refugee camp has evolved into a struggling town hosting thousands of Cyran refugees. Prince Oargev holds court in New Cyre, considering himself a king in exile. Though resources are scarce, New Cyre remains a symbol of hope for many refugees. It's also a last stop for those determined to explore the Mournland.
