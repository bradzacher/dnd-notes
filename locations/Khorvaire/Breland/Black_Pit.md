# Black Pit

A massive chasm in the Blackcap Mountains, the Black Pit is over a mile across and descends beyond the limits of sight. It's said to be an entrance to the abyss of Khyber, and foul creatures live among the caves that honeycomb its walls. A nearby village—also called Black Pit—provides a haven for deserters and other criminals as well as a thriving black market.

If you have shady friends, you've likely heard of Black Pit's reputation as a place to quietly "disappear." Similarly, if you have ties to the King's Dark Lanterns, you know where to find some of Breland's worst criminals.
