# Bazaar of Dura

The Bazaar of Dura is the largest commercial district in Sharn. In addition to the dozens of permanent shops and smithies, the streets of the bazaar are an ever-changing tapestry of stalls and tents. It's said that you can find anything here, if you're not too worried about where it came from and if you're prepared to contend with the cutpurses that prey on the crowds.
