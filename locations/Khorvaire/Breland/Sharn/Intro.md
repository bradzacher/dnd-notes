_When you live on the inside low, you never see the sun. People hear "towers," they think of graceful little spires, the sort of thing you see poking up in the corner of your lord's keep. We've got those, and lots of 'em. But the foundation of the city is the core towers. The walls of these towers are so thick you could fit your lord's castle in one._

_You've got your outside districts where you get the open air, built on the bridges and platforms that connect the core towers together. You've got the little turrets, built on the core tower walls and the bridges between. You've got the folk in the middle, who live and work in the walls themselves. And then you've got those of us on the inside, our districts entirely contained in the hollow well of a great tower. When you look up in Callestan, you see twinkling lights, to be sure. But those aren't stars, and that isn't the sky. You're looking up through a mile of bridges and platforms crossing the well, looking up at the districts above you._

_You live up high, you can touch the sky. In the middle you can still see the sun. Down on the inside low, all we have is gloom and the constant drip, water and worse descending from the city above us._
