## Story

- Vohilda Higglefritz grew up as a Halfling in the Talenta Plains as part of House Ghallanda.
- As part of her family's farm, she raised Mr Higgins from an egg and the two have been inseparable friends ever since.
- Her cousin Ralph stole a precious ring from her given to her by her Grandmother.
- Mr Higgins goes missing the day after.
- At night he wakes her up, when she is lying in bed, blood across her body and mouth, with the ring grasped gently in his teeth. Only after she hears the cries for the missing Ralph does she realize what has happened and decides to flee the life she loves to protect her best friend.
- She is currently in the city of Sharn to stay hidden from her family, make a living to survive and also find a veterinarian who can help her understand why Mr Higgins ate her cousin.
- She has been training with crossbows since little and given these skills has been able to survive as a runaway in such an unfamiliar place.

Vohilda Higglefritz is a fake name. Her real name is **XXXXXXXXXXXX** d'Ghallanda.
Her mark is on her arm, right now it is hidden to help her remain incognito.

## Information Given

- Ghallanda made a lot of money during the last war feeding armies on all sides.
- Ghallanda inns are found anywhere and everywhere. Not all are run by dragonmarked heirs, but the best are.
- Ghallanda owns more enclaves (aka its inns) than any other house - by a large margin.
- Under the signing of the Treaty of Thronehold Ghallanda secured concessions freeing their enclaves from the local law, effectively turning them into individual nations.
  - Ghallanda holds no quarrel with their customers, so long as they pay. Anyone who is wanted can escape the law by visiting a Ghallanda enclave.
- Ghallanda's power doesn't come from its business, it comes in the form of its connections to communities.
  - If you ever want to know what's happening in a town, who better to ask than the innkeeper who's been lending an ear to those who need it?

Halflings of the talenta plains are nomadic. The map of the plains is bare of cities not because it's uninhabitable, but instead because there aren't many.
