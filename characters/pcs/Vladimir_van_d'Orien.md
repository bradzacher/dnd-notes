# Vladimir van d'Orien

## Story

If there was one word to describe Vlad, it would be fast. Vlad has always had a need for speed, so it was no surprise when his mark of passage manifested. Vlad has a history of being an experienced driver/teamster and his unquenchable desire for speed (with often reckless abandon) earned him his nickname -- the speed demon. Rising through the ranks, Vlad became a house agent working on a number of Baron Kwanti's pet projects: the lightning rail and experiments with long-distance teleportation. Vlad is journeying to secure funds for the projects, and discover ways to go faster and faster. Planning to either build him as a rogue or a monk. Vlad would be a chaotic neutral human.

The reason I am in sharn is two fold. One, I need to raise funds for my house projects (I'm one of the people helping out the house with its ambitious project to rebuild and extend the lightning rail) and my own pet projects (I've got a custom ride that I've tricked out like a gear head to be lean and mean and I want to tune it some more) and I've been contacted by Germaine as an old friend. Two, I'd like to scout out the competition for the race of the eight winds. I've always had a passion for racing, but mostly on the ground. I've only recently heard of this new aerial cavalry race, and I've got it say: It piques my interest -- enough to potentially sign up as a competitor.

## Information Given

- Orien has many exploits in ground transportation.
  - Lightning rail ofc
  - Coaches and caravans
  - Postal services and couriers
- Orien works closely with house Sivis (if you need to send a letter notarized by Sivis, Orien is your best bet)
- Orien works closely with house Vadalis. They provide magebred creatures that are faster and better than mundane counterparts.
- Orien works closely with house Cannith. They helped build the lightning rail
- In the recent years, Orien has become at-odds with house Lyrandar. The recent (~2-4 years) introduction of skyships for overland travel is starting to undercut some business.
  - Whilst not as fast (~20mph vs rail's ~30mph), and more expensive per mile, skyships are quieter, smoother and larger - which the rich are liking.
  - Some nobles are looking to hire out personal skyships and dropping their contracts for personal lightning rail cars.
- Orien has are projects underway to reduce the costs (both magical and gold) of teleportation. Nothing fruitful just yet.
  - Teleportation services are currently sold for 2,500gp per trip
  - Teleportation still sees heavy use amongst nobles and other dragonmarked houses. With politics the way they are, instant transportation is highly valued.

Lightning Rail:

- The lightning rail was originally a royal commission - first funded by the Galifar crown in 811YK, and made a continental project in 845YK.
  - The project completed in 865YK (around 30 years before the start of the Last War).
- The last war seriously damaged the lightning rail infrastructure.
  - Bridges were destroyed (such as the White Arch Bridge between Karrnath and Thrane)
  - Tracks were sabotaged
  - Cyre was the hub of a lot of the infrastructure, and The Mourning destroyed it.
- Orien is lobbying hard politically to try and get funding to repair the damage and build new sections of lightning rail to reconnect Khorvaire
  - Though the nations are not yet in support, as the ink on the Treaty of Thronehold is barely dry
- Orien has sent explorers into the Mournland to inspect the conductor stones.

  - Some rumors report that parts of the track are warped and twisted, others report stones are stolen, creating gaps large enough to derail a train
  - Orien has yet to send a commercial train through the Mournland.

- Passage in Aundair is the headquarters of the house.
  - Specifically "Journey's Home" is the name of the enclave - named in reference to the amount of time most house heirs would be away from it.
  - Journey's Home takes up about one third of the city of Passage and employs nearly half the city's workforce.

You know of some house cannith artificers that can create near-perfect prosthetic limb replacements.
Models built to withstand combat are rare and expensive, however.
Rumour has it some of the more extravagant models have weapons or enchantments built in.

As an Orien scion living in sharn, you would likely live somewhere in Tavick's Landing - likely in Middle Tavick's landing.

- Terminus station (in lower Tavick's Landing) is the one and only lightning rail station for the city, and one of two ways to get into the city by land - the other land entrance being Wroann's Gate (also in Tavick's Landing).
- As Tavick's landing is the only entrance to the city, it's heavily fortified and has a strong military presence.
- House Deneith is contracted to maintain a strong presence in the entirety of this district.
- You would also know of (at least one of) the vast and exclusive estates owned by the house in Sharn.
  - The Unicorn Estate is situated in the Mithral Tower district in Upper Central Plateau.
  - Some of the much higher-ranking heirs live there.
  - Rumor has it that the grounds of the estate are magically enchanted.
