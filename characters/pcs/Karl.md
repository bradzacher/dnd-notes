## Story

Karl, The Avatar of Woe

I was born in the Demon Wastes to parents who wanted more than what the tribes could offer. When I was small we emigrated to Cyre where they found work and made a better life for us. Though I was "touched by evil" and not well liked, my magical gifts made me a useful ally to the other children. My father and mother were both powerful wizards...they had wanted their child to be even more powerful and successful. They were searching for the anti-life equation, the opposite of gods. In my horns is carved an intricate pattern of numbers. A deal must have been made.

Cyre was right to claim the mantle of rulership, but they were foolish and their gods false. The Mourning proved that. My parents used up all their power to save me. I made my way to Sharn with other refugees as a teenager. It was a hub of opportunity for those with ambiguous morals and the force of will to do what must be done. I have been working to gather enough wealth and power to begin the revolution against the false kings and gods that would bring such destruction as the Mourning upon their people. Everything I do is for the people! It has been slow going, we need more pamphlets

I've made it a point to know those in power and recruit them to the revolution whenever possible. I've had a few dealings with Sergeant Vilroy and other members of the Sharn watch. I've taken a few jobs to get in their good graces, handed out a few pamphlets. One will need the security forces to be compliant if one expects a coup d'etat to succeed.

## Information Given

As a Cyran refugee, likely you moved to the "High Walls" district in lower Tavick's Landing in Sharn.

Here's a bit of info about High Walls:
This district was converted into an internment center during the Last War. Since the end of the war, it has been transformed into a refugee camp. Most of the residents are Cyrans who fled the Mourning, but High Walls also includes Brelish citizens who lost their homes in the war. It's a crowded and dangerous place, but it allows residents to maintain a squalid lifestyle at no cost. Currently the gates are open, but the Sharn Watch could seal them at any time.

No doubt you would have done some research into aberrant dragonmarks.
Aberrant dragonmarks are rare dragonmarks that can appear on anyone from any race at any time - _regardless of bloodline_.

Whilst the 12 dragonmarks are generally constructive, the powers of aberrant dragonmarks is usually destructive.
These powers (just like regular dragonmarks) can be channeled through focus items to increase their potency.
Most people with aberrant marks were killed off in the War of the Mark some 2500 years ago, and now a days those with aberrant marks hide themselves away, for fear of meeting a similar fate.

A notable example of an aberrant dragonmark is Halas Tarkanan. With a focus item, Tarkanan was able to summon powerful earthquakes that could devastate cities.
Tarkanan died in the war of the mark - he and other leaders of the Aberrant forces chose to use their powers to decimate Sharn (their base of operations) rather than give the Houses the satisfaction of defeating him.
His legacy lives on even today through House Tarkanan - a criminal organisation operating in Sharn, whose members are mostly those with aberrant marks.

If you can somehow figure out how to gain an aberrant mark, maybe you too can be gifted with the greater powers to help "peacefully subdue" the people.
