## Story

I was a member of the lower class in Sharn, I spent much of my childhood with my single mother until she passed, I worked or was indebted to a faction agent of house cannith and he took a liking to my quick wit and intellect, eventually I was put under his tutelage and started formally studying magic, after my apprenticeship I joined house cannith as an agent and since then I've been working with them on all manner of tasks, rarely dangerous, more often than not related to trade.

I want to become rich/powerful so I don't have to see any of my family suffer like I did when I was younger. As a result I'm extremely critical of the lower class, I don't like spending time with what I deem weak people because it sheds light on my own insecurities as a pauper

Everyone in my mind has opportunity and it's there responsibility to become great, not anyone else's, if they fail they deserve to

## Information Given

As someone that works for Cannith, you would know the following:

- Cannith maintains close relationships with all nations and houses.
- Cannith has had a hand in most, if not all magical artifice in Khorvaire. From the Orien lightning rail to the Sivis message stations.
- Cannith was a major party in the war, aiding every nation - selling arms and armaments to every army. This made the house very rich.
- There are "cults" of sorts within the house. Many members of the house worship the Traveler, and beseech him for inspiration for their creations.
- Cannith created the warforged ~30 years ago.
  - There were many iterations and failed experiments along the way.
  - Even with Cannith itself, people are unsure how the first artificers were able to make the necessary leaps to create true sentience.
  - A lot of people assume that it's the influence of the Traveler.
  - There were also larger variations of warforged created:
    - Warforged Titans were created and fielded in battle. Hulking huge constructs - they lack the true sentience of their smaller kin, but have enough intelligence to function autonomously on the battlefield.
    - You heard rumours of much larger Warforged that were created and fielded at the end of the Last War, you don't know any more than that.

You likely would have spent some time studying at Morgrave University.

At the heart of Sharn's Morgrave University is a sharp dichotomy: On the one hand, it is known as a nexus for scholars wishing to study Xen'drik, thanks in large part to Sharn's proximity to the secret continent. Its collections of artifacts and scholarly works about ancient Xen'drik and the Dhakaan Empire are unparalleled. In many ways, it lives up to the shining vision of its founder, Lord Lareth ir'Morgrave, to be "a beacon of knowledge shining from the tallest towers of the city."

On the other hand, the university's reputation is tainted by allegations of smuggling, treasure hunting, and profiteering. Many priceless relics recovered from Xen'drik or Dhakaani ruins have disappeared from the university vaults and found their way to the black market or into the hands of the Aurum. It's an open secret that some scholars, professors, and even students at the university have ties to smugglers and thieves. All these allegations, too, have ties to the university's founding: Lord Morgrave himself is said to have made his fortune selling Dhakaani artifacts on the black market, and some have claimed that the true purpose of the university was to help him build his fortune through such questionable means.

You would have done your research over the years about wealth and power and how it is distributed and who has it.

The largest "collection" of wealthy elite lie in the Aurum.

The Aurum is an exclusive society for the richest and most influential people of Khorvaire. Merchants, priests, military officers, and other luminaries gather for grand galas and salons.

The Aurum is divided into four suborders called Concords — copper, silver, gold, and platinum, in order of ascendance. Higher rank provides a member with improved access to the resources of the Aurum and a greater voice in society meetings. The Aurum isn't a secret society, and its meeting halls can be found in most major cities. Many powerful people openly wear the eight rings — one on each finger, with the metal indicating the rank of the wearer — that label them as Aurum members. The Aurum frequently engages in acts of philanthropy, and thus some members might be celebrated by their local communities.
