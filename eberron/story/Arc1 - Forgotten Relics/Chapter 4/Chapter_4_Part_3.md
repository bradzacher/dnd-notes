# Part 3 - The Masquerade

## Descriptions

- Trolanport:
  - With its crisscrossing canals and flooded streets, the capital of Zilargo serves as the center of the gnome shipbuilding industry and a nexus for trade.
  - Scores of ships make port here daily.
  - Among the many beautiful things the city is known for are its spectacular coastal thunderstorms.
  - Crowds gather on balconies and verandas to watch these awesome displays.
  - The Tower of the Triumvirate rises over the central portion of the city.
- Korranberg:
  - Korranberg is a large city in Zilargo. It is the oldest city in Zilargo and, despite not being the capital of the nation, is arguably the most important.
  - It is home to the vaunted Library of Korranberg, which is more than a library but perhaps the greatest collection of knowledge on the world of Eberron and among the best universities

## Notes

- [[Neya ir'Krell]] is the Aundairian ambassador in Zilargo.
  - However, she is also a member of the [[Royal Eyes of Aundair]].
  - Outwardly, Neya spends most of her time at the embassy.
  - At night she occasionally sneaks out for secret missions and meetings.
- The Aundairian embassy in Korranberg is the second such embassy in Zilargo.
  - It's brand new - and is set to open in a few days.
  - Neya has been overseeing the project to ensure it's safe and secure from any espionage.
- To celebrate the completion, a Masquerade ball has been organised.
  - The ball will occur 2 nights after the PCs arrive in Korranberg.
- Lucan will meet with Neya in secret the night before the ball.
  - Neya arranges for some papers to help him start a new life in Karrnath.
  - She will deliver these papers to him at the ball.

## Situation

- If the PCs visit the embassy, Majordomo Jayres Tachiot will screen their visit.
  - He will not allow them an audience with Neya, for she is very busy preparing for the ball.
  - If they push - he will gladly schedule a meeting for 4 days time (after the ball)
    - By this point, [[Lucan Stellos]] will be long gone.
  - If they can convince Jayres that they are nobility or high ranking dragonmarked members, he will invite them to the ball.
- If PCs stake out the embassy:
  - There are two guards posted at the front gate at all times.
    - The guards change over once every hour.
  - They'll see all manner of deliveries coming in.
    - Most of the deliveries go through a side entrance, which isn't guarded overly well.
  - If they are watching the night before the ball.
    - DC 15 Wisdom (Perception) check will note a woman leaving the servant's entrance very late at night.

## Getting into the party

- Conditions for entry:
  1. _Each guest **must** have an invitation._
     - Invitations do not have +1's.
     - Invitations are unnamed.
     - The guards collect invitations upon entry and place them in a metal box at their feet.
       - PCs can attempt to steal from the box, but it'll be hard
         - DC20 Dexterity (Slight of Hand).
         - If the PC rolls above 12, but below 20 - they can decide if they want to:
           - Back out and not be noticed, or
           - Grab the invitation and be noticed.
         - Mage hand can be used, but they will need a distraction.
     - A guest arrives about every 5 minutes.
       - The PCs can attempt to steal from a guest - not hard as they are unarmed nobles.
  2. _Guests must surrender weapons and any obviously dangerous magic._
     - The guards will assess every single guest looking for weapons.
     - Any weapons that the PCs don't conceal will be noticed.
     - PCs can attempt to conceal light weapons with a DC 13 Dexterity (Slight of Hand) check.
       - Daggers confer advantage on this check.
       - Particularly loose clothing similarly provides advantage.
     - Guards will ask about anything obviously magical - but they're not trained and will believe what they're told.
  3. _Guests must be properly attired._
     - At a minimum this means a noble outfit plus a mask.
     - Other guests will be wearing fanciful and expensive clothing, fit for royalty.
     - A few blocks away is the Elysium Clothier, where PCs can buy appropriate clothes:
       - Noble outfits for 75gp
       - Royal outfits for 300gp
       - Masquerade costumes for 100-500gp depending on how gaudy / fanciful it is.
     - Armour and shields are strictly prohibited.
- PCs can attempt to use invisibility or charm spells to bypass the guards.
  - There are no magical protections to prevent this.
- PCs can attempt to sneak in through the back entrance.
  - If they dress appropriately - nobody will question them as they make their way into the party.
  - They could also dress as servants and blend in that way
    - The guards are not yet familiar with the staff, so they won't be noticed, if they don't act suspicious.

## The Ball

- If the PCs approach the gate:

> Blinking magical lights created by gnome entertainers guide you through the Aundairian Embassy's courtyard toward a set of heavy wooden doors.
> Beyond the doors, you hear the sound of music and laughter.
> Two gnomes in full plate with hooked hammers at their sides stand on either side of the doors.
> A box full of white paper sits next to their feet.
> "Welcome to the Night of a Thousand Stars. Invitations, please," one gnome says glumly.

- Once the PCs are in the ball

> Every wall of the ballroom has been festooned with black and white crepe, and drifting, darting magical lights provide the room's illumination.
> A quartet of elf musicians plays in a far corner of the ballroom, providing music for approximately a dozen dancers.
> About forty other people sit at round tables or stand around the edge of the dance floor, conversing in quiet tones while servants bring them drinks and small tidbits of food.
> The ballroom's most striking feature is the costumes that everyone — host, guest, and servant alike - wears.
> Everyone also wears a mask, many decorated with feathers, fur, sequins, or costume jewelry.
> Many of the women have on long, diaphanous gowns, while the men wear form-fitting breeches and vests that glitter with golden thread and the sparkle of tiny gems.
> It appears that about a third of the guests are gnomes.

- Senses
  - Light:
    - Orbs produced by a _dancing lights_ spell drift across the room, providing dim lighting throughout the room
  - Sound:
    - There's a murmur from the crowd as they all talk and laugh.
    - There's an elvish quartet on the stage playing.
      - This imposes disadvantage on all eaves-dropping attempts.
- Food and Drink
  - Servants circle the crowd with cards that are loaded with drinks and small delicacies from both Aundair and Zilargo.
  - The carts have two shelves, one lower for the gnomes to reach easier.
  - Each time someone has a drink - they must make a DC13 Wisdom Save.
    - On a failure, they are affected by a "Loose Lips" effect - wherein they talk a little too much about themselves.
    - This effect lasts until they complete a long rest.
- Crowd
  - The attendees are a mixed group, racially.
  - Gnomes make up the largest percentage, unsurprisingly, and are closely followed by humans.
  - A few half-elves, elves, and dwarves are present, and there is even a pair of hobgoblins – presumably diplomats from Darguun.
  - Everyone is masked and dressed extravagantly.
  - **Masks impose disadvantage on most Wisdom (Insight) checks**, as they make it hard to read expressions.
- Gathering information
  - The PCs can talk to whomever they please.
  - If they are in cheap clothes, they will receive a -2 penalty to any checks.
  - If the PCs spend some time talking to the crowd before asking questions, they can bump the crowd's attitude to positive.
    - DC 15 Charisma (Persuasion, Performance or Deception) check.
    - If they fail, some of the crowd will have a negative attitude, meaning they'll start asking questions about who the PCs are.
  - Information the crowd can tell them when friendly:
    - The hostess is wearing a red dress and a Gold Dragon mask.
      - Neya
    - A gruff man with a brelish accent is wearing an eagle mask and wearing a glove on one hand.
      - Lucan
    - A positively enchanting woman is wearing an owl mask.
      - Grilsha
    - There's an interesting Aundairian woman wearing a Blue Dragon mask.
      - Meena.
  - If the PCs ask too many questions, the crowd will get suspicious.
- Stealing from guests
  - DC18 Dexterity (Sleight of Hand) check. Disadvantage due to the number of bystanders.
  - On success - roll a d100
    - 01–50, 2d12 gp;
    - 51–75, 2d6 pp;
    - 76–90, jewelry worth 1d4××100 gp;
    - 91–100, jewelry worth 2d4××100 gp.
  - On failure the guest alerts the guards.

## Aftermath

- Neya should survive combat. The PCs can interact with her after the fight for information.
  - She is untrusting of the PCs, and requires a DC12 Charisma (Persuasion) check to relax her.
  - Neya has a strong sense of patriotism, and a strong loyalty to her friends.
  - Things she knows:
    - On the vampire blade:
      - The vampire blade is an ancient and powerful artefact
        > There are few things feared by the vampire lords.
        > Sunlight, of course. The few beings more powerful than them – dragons, daelkyr, ancient deathless, and the like.
        > Those things... and the vampire blade.
        > They don't fear the blade itself, per se, though it is no simple weapon.
        > Rather they fear what the blade can do to the kingdoms that they have created in the night.
        >
        > According to the stories, in the early days (or nights, rather) of Galifar, a powerful vampire lord built a
        > network of brilliant and ambitious thralls that extended across much of Breland and Cyre.
        > One of these thralls had been a skilled artificer – some say it was a member of House Cannith who lacked a mark
        > and had to work doubly hard to keep up because of it.
        > This artificer was made one of the vampire lord's spawn to better maintain control.
        > In secret, though, the artificer worked and created a blade capable of cutting through the ties of blood and
        > power that its master had over it.
        > Freed from its master, the artificer-vampire came into its own power and caused an uprising among the vampire lord's thralls.
        >
        > Rumors say that the blade has been in the possession of Calderus in the depths of Sharn for over a century.
        > Other rumors say that she spent a decade hunting down the artificer who created it.
    - On Lucan:
      - Lucan was a member of the [[King's Dark Lanterns]].
        - This is how Neya met him and worked with him.
        - As a spy, Lucan knows too much to be a free man.
      - Lucan is not a bad man
        - Neya has known him for many years, but he has never been this base or brutal.
        - He would never kill a man unless he needed to.
    - On the night:
      - Neya served her friendship by providing Lucan with the means for escape.
      - Neya served her country by tipping off the Aundairian spies.
      - It was up to the whims of the gods to determine Lucan's fate that night.
        - If he was captured, then he is to be captured.
        - If he escaped, then he is to be free.
      - Neya did not expect Lucan to get enraged such that he would fight and kill anyone.
    - On next steps:
      - Neya's contact (Edvin) provided Lucan with travelling papers to get him to Karrnath via airship.
      - The airship is scheduled to leave in the morning.
