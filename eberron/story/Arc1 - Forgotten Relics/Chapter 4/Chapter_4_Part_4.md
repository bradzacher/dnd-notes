# Part 4 - Sky Raiders

## Rough notes

- Lucan is aboard "The Auburn Eagle", which is heading to Karrnath.
- Grilsha has cast _Immovable Object_ on the door to the tower.
- She will emerge and close it behind her.
- The figure of a gnomish child will melt and shift into the familiar form of Grilsha as a wall of fire flares up around you.
  > My brother is a good man.
  > He didn't choose for any of this shit to happen to him.
  > He deserves a new life.
  > He deserves his second chance.
  > I will not let you get in his way.
- Lucan has charmed 5 gnomish guards (use the Embassy Guard stat block) to help her fight off the PCs.
- During the fight, the airship will depart.
- Garrow (disguised as a half-elf named "Captain Rarwog") will happily help them out for a small fee.
- Garrow's smaller, lighter airship "Jade's Fury" will be able to catch up with "The Auburn Eagle" within a day
