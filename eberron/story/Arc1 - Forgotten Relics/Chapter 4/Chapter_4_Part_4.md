# Part 4 - Sky Raiders

## Rough notes

- Lucan is aboard "The Auburn Eagle", which is heading to Karrnath.
- Grilsha has cast _Immovable Object_ on the door to the tower.
- She will emerge and close it behind her.
- The figure of a gnomish child will melt and shift into the familiar form of Grilsha as a wall of fire flares up around you.
  > My brother is a good man.
  > He didn't choose for any of this shit to happen to him.
  > He deserves a new life.
  > He deserves his second chance.
  > I will not let you get in his way.
- Lucan has charmed 5 gnomish guards (use the Embassy Guard stat block) to help her fight off the PCs.
- During the fight, the airship will depart.
- Garrow (disguised as a half-elf named "Captain Rarwog") will happily help them out for a small fee.
- Garrow's smaller, lighter airship "Jade's Fury" will be able to catch up with "The Auburn Eagle" within a day

## Treasure

- Grilsha has a spellshard with the following spells:
  - Level 1: Alarm, Detect Magic, Mage Armor, Shield, Silent Image
  - Level 2: Alter Self, Invisibility
  - Level 3: Fly, Lightning Bolt, Fireball, Counterspell
  - Level 4: Wall of Fire

The rest I made up as we went by mashing the remix and the old version together.

Rough notes:

- Rarwog (Garrow) was captaining the Jade Fury
- Happy to have the characters pay to have him follow the auburn eagle
- While aboard Rarwog will talk to the characters in his quarters
  - He will be friendly, but ask a lot of questions
  - He will try to probe about the player's deeper intentions and cause
  - He will attempt to get some idea of what they know about their patron (Elaydren) and the schemas
- They will catch up after nightfall
- Rarwog will offer to ferry the PCs over on a air skiff
  - Players attempt to stealthily board the ship
  - Whist boarding, the pirates attack the ship
  - Players can intervene or sneak aboard
- Below deck is a lot of cargo and rooms at the front and rear of the ship
  - Front has one empty room and one room with a crew member in it who will assume the PCs are pirates and attack
  - Back has 4 rooms
    - one has a gnome mage who will blast the PCs with burning hands when they open the door
    - one has a scared gnome who is cowering and offers whatever they need as long as they don't hurt him
    - one is empty
    - the last one has Lucan
- Lucan will talk to them for as long as he feels is necessary.
  - He will not give up the blade.
  - He wants his freedom.
  - He will attempt to convince the PCs to let him go free.
- If the PCs fight lucan - he will start by attempting to charm one of them.
  - Pick the least charismatic of the PCs if possible.
  - When he gets low, he will transform into a bat and attempt to run.
  - If they manage to kill him - he will convert to a mist and float slowly.
    - The PCs have no tools to deal with this.
- When the PCs are talking to Lucan, there will be a brief (~2s) period of absolute silence.
  - Perceptive PCs will feel the ship slowing down.
  - During the conversation the "magical circuitry" in the walls flash and the PCs hear a roar beneath desk
    - This flashing should happen a few times.
  - Either at the start of combat, or shortly after the social encounter resolves the final flash comes and the circuitry looks like it fizzles.
    - The thing roars - much louder.
  - The PCs feel the deck pitch nose down - **THE AIRSHIP IS GOING DOWN**.
    - The PCs have a few rounds of time to figure out what they're doing
    - Make them stress. Interrupt them and make sure they feel the pressure.
    - If they don't escape the crash - they will be knocked unconscious at 0 hp.
- After the crash there will be the Fire Elemental roaming the wreckage angrily.
- The PCs can search the wreckage.
  - Everything is destroyed - nothing of value remains
  - Wisdom (Survival) and Intelligence (Investigation) checks can reveal a set of footprints leading away from the crash.
    - The higher the roll the faster they find them.
  - DC10 means they find it just before the pirates arrive to search the wreckage.
- They can follow the footprints to a nearby ruined temple.
  - DC10 survival means it takes them 1 hour to get there.
  - Adjust time taken based on roll.
- Lucan is in the basement, which a necromancer had made their home.
  - The PCs will see the bloody body of the necromancer on the floor and Lucan with his face covered in blood - clearly having just fed.
  - The basement has 4 cages - all of which house zombies.
    - Lucan knows the magical command word to unlock the cells - simply the elvish word for "open".
    - These zombies will not attack Lucan as he is undead.
    - The elvish word for "close" will lock the cells.
- Lucan will fight to the death here. He will not attempt to run.
  - When he reaches 0hp he will drop the sword and turn into mist.
  - His mist will float upstairs and into the dawn break.
  - The PCs can follow him and watch him burst into flames with the first light of dawn.
  - From his ashes they can retrieve a glove of storing.
- The pirates will follow after the PCs about 2 hours later.
  - The PCs can fight or they can run.
  - If they run, the pirates will find nothing and just leave.
  - The PCs will be stranded in the middle of nowhere.
- Survival checks ensue as they need to figure out where they are.
  - They are about 60 miles west of the deep mine.
- Upon arrival back in Sharn - they can send word to meet up with Elaydren.
  - Elaydren will again meet with them at Ertur's Shield.
  - The setup will be exactly the same.
  - The spy associate will be there and take notes.
  - If the PCs haven't figure it out yet - the spy will chuckle when they mention the name "Rarwog".
    - She will reveal that it is an anagram for Garrow.
  - Elaydren will pay the PCs 500gp each.
- Elaydren will offer the PCs more work in a week's time.
  - She is close to figuring out the location of the last schema.
  - She tells them it will be a dangerous quest though as she believes it is on Xen'drik.
  - She says she will contact them in about a week.
