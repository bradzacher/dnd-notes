# Part One - Elaydren's Revenge

## The Shield at Sword Point

- Elaydren sends a message to the PCs, asking to meet at an inn called Ertur's Shield in Sword Point (Middle Central).
  - Ertur's Shield is a tavern that caters to off-duty watch members.

> From the outside it looks homey, warm and intimate.
> Plastered walls and marble pillars make up most of the building's outer structure.
> It's impossible to see through the darkened windows, but the passionate voices from within can be felt outside.
>
> As you enter the tavern through the decorated, wooden door, you're welcomed by laughing voices and a pleasant atmosphere.
> A portly halfling bartender is quite busy pouring drinks, but still manages to welcome you with a smile.
>
> It's as engaging inside as it is on the outside.
> Rounded, stone beams support the upper floor and the lanterns attached to them.
> The walls are packed with rows of painted portraits.
> You recognize the bartender on one of them, so the others must be either friends, family or previous owners.
>
> The tavern itself is modestly filled - one could neither describe the place as full or empty.
> Gruff soldier-types seem to make up most of the clientele, and you can pick out a few men wearing the livery of the Watch.
> Several long tables are occupied by happy, excited groups of people, some are dancing on the table, while others cheer them on with clapping and yelling.
>
> One of the walls boasts a number of shadowed archways, which you watch a young halfling waiter carry a fresh platter of food into.

- Bartender's name is Flynkas.
- Waiter's name is Tambo.
  - He will lead the PCs to the private room when asked.

> The halfling leads to through one of the archways, and inside you find a cosy, but dimly lit private room.
> Inside is a small table, barely big enough to seat the lot of you.
>
> On the table sits a selection of cured meats and cheeses, as well as a number of goblets, and a bottle of Eldeen wine.
> At the table you recognise Lady Elaydren, and beside her is what looks to be an elven woman, wrapped in a well-worn traveler's cloak.
>
> Elaydren smiles warmly as you enter, and gestures for you all to sit.
>
> He smiles politely, as he lingers for a moment - awaiting any orders.

- The elf is Areyndee, though she is disguised with magic.
- Once the halfling returns with their orders and leaves, Elaydren will properly address the PCs

> My friends, when we spoke in Darguun not so long ago, I mentioned striking back at the Emerald Claw for their meddling.
> Since then, I have been preparing to do so.
> My associate here from House Thuranni has collected information regarding the vampire, Garrow, and his plans.
> We are now in a position to take action and see that those plans do not come to fruition.
> If you are willing to be my agents in carrying out those plans, I will see you well rewarded.

- Answers to the PC's questions:
  - Q: Why are we meeting here instead of at the Broken Anvil?
    > As you may recall, our meeting was... interrupted the last time we met there.
    > I no longer consider it a secure place.
    > I am known to come to this tavern now and then – I live nearby.
    > Even if I were followed here, no one would think it odd.
    > Also, the regular clientele should be helpful if we were to have another interruption.
  - Q: You mentioned a reward?
    > Yes. If you choose to assist me, you will need to leave Sharn as soon as possible.
    > The next airship scheduled to leave for Korranberg is tomorrow morning.
    > I will provide you with advance funds of 500 gold and an item of Cannith manufacture that I expect may be useful.
    > If you accomplish certain tasks as part of this endeavor, there are potential bonuses worth several thousand gold.
  - Q: Who is your associate?
    > She will remain nameless for the moment, as anonymity can be crucial in her line of work.
    > Suffice it to say that she has undertaken the task of collecting information on that odious vampire, Brother Garrow, and his compatriots in the Emerald Claw.
- If the PCs agree to help, she continues:

> "This is excellent news.
> It seems as though Garrow has been looking into multiple magical artifacts presumed lost under Sharn.
> One of these is a sword that, until two days ago, was in the possession of an ancient vampire who dwells in the depths of the city."
>
> Elaydren turns and gestures to her associate to continue
>
> "[[Calderus]]. Ancient vampire. Based in the undercity of Sharn.
> Has agents throughout the city."
>
> You watch as she reaches into her pocket, and pulls out a small bit of some cloth or something.
> With a wave of her hand you see the illusory face appears.
>
> "[[Lucan Stellos]].
> Citadel agent in Sharn.
> Eight days ago multiple anonymous letters were sent to various officials.
> They revealed Stellos to be under the control of Calderus.
> Apparently, unwillingly."
>
> She waves her hand again and different face appears.
> This one is somewhat familiar.
>
> "[[Edvin Garm]].
> Emerald Claw agent in Sharn.
> Eight days ago met with Stellos and passed him a letter.
> This occurred approximately an hour before Lucan Stellos was outed.
> Likely responsible for outing Stellos, but that is unconfirmed.
> Stellos disappeared within hours."
>
> This time another familiar face appears.
>
> "[[Garrow]].
> Goes by “Brother” Garrow.
> Vampire. Not ancient. Priest of the Blood of Vol.
> Agent of the Emerald Claw.
> Was spotted in Korranberg six days ago -- nights, rather.
> Some Emerald Claw activity still going on there."
>
> The next face is that of a woman, not too dissimilar to the first.
>
> "[[Grilsha Stellos]].
> Lucan's sister. Raised him. Very close. Protective.
> Lives in Ivy Towers. Magically talented."
>
> With a flick of her wrist, the illusion fades.
>
> "Lucan reappeared the night before last.
> Seen at the residence of his sister.
> He had a magic sword in his possession.
> It matched the description of the one Garrow was studying.
> The vampire blade.
>
> Both Lucan and Grilsha disappeared that night.
> Last night, both of their residences were searched by agents of [[Calderus]]."
>
> The woman glances over at Elaydren.
>
> "Thank you.
> We think Lucan and his sister are still alive and on the run.
> Our best guess is that they are headed to Korranberg to meet with Garrow.
> I suspect to exchange the sword for something – probably including some sort of guarantee of safety from Calderus.
> Lucan also has an associate in Korranberg, an Aundairian ambassador, [[Neya ir'Krell]].
> It is also possible he will seek her out.
>
> I want you to head to Korranberg and disrupt whatever Garrow is planning.
> If you can recover the vampire blade, that would be ideal.
> Anything else you can recover – including information on Garrow's plans, his allies, or his research notes – will be compensated.
> Well compensated.
> As long as you prevent Garrow from acquiring the vampire blade, I will consider your assignment a success.
> With your success, you will have an additional sum of 300 gold each waiting for you as a reward.
> If you bring me the blade, I'll double that.
>
> The next airship flight to Korranberg leaves Sharn tomorrow shortly before noon.
> I have procured tickets for you.

- Answers to the PC's questions:
  - Q: What is the vampire blade?
    > Unfortunately, we know almost nothing about it, except that Garrow wants it.
    > From what little we do know, we suspect it is particularly valuable to vampires.
  - Q: What is the Emerald Claw doing in Korranberg?
    > A few weeks ago, they shipped a large number of items out from a Korranberg warehouse by lightning rail.
    > Garrow was seen at the Aundairian embassy in Korranberg last week.
    > Edvin Garm was last seen in Sharn boarding an airship flight to Korranberg.
    > This was a few hours after he met with Stellos.
- Elaydren hands them a plain travel bag, containing:
  - 3 flasks of holy water
  - a wand of light bearing the mark of a House Cannith artificer
  - a pouch containing 45 pp and 50 gp
  - a letter of credit with House Ghallanda covering a week's worth of room and board for the PCs at the Korranberg Gold Dragon Inn.
  - Tickets for passage to Korranberg on the Cloud's Destiny, a House Lyrandar airship, scheduled to leave the next day.

## Destiny Awaits

- Players now have a day to prepare!

> The lift flies smoothly up the tower, taking you to the upper levels of Lyrandar tower - to the airship docks.
> As the doors to the lift open, it reveals a busy platform - a few dozen people crowd the platform.
> Docked at the edge of the platform you can see the magnificent sight of two airships - the _Cloud's Destiny_ and the _River of Stars_.
>
> You hear shouts and whistles as the dock staff work to corral the aboard their respective craft.
> Teamsters are making room and pushing paths through the crowd as they load luggage and other cargo into the ships.
>
> About half of the crowd appears to be gnomes, boarding the Cloud's Destiny on the way to Zilargo.

- Everyone rolls a perception check.
  - DC20 Wisdom (Perception) will reveal a familiar halfling in the crowd - the waiter from Ertur's Shield.
  - Tambo is here to ensure the PCs embark on their journey, and signals a waiting glidewing-rider, who flies off to prepare.
  - Tambo will attempt to flee if he is noticed.
    - The PCs can attempt to chase, but the Lyrandar guards will not look favourably upon armed adventurers accosting a teenage halfling.
