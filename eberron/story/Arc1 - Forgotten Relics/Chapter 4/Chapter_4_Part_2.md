# Part 2 - The Flight of the Destiny

> The Lyrandar deckhand shows you to your cabins - 5 small, but well-appointed rooms.
> To one side is an ornate armoire, and most of the other floorspace is taken up by the bed.
> The rooms are brightly lit by everbright lanterns.
>
> "These rooms are yours for the duration of our journey.
> On the lower deck you will find both the lounge, which provides great views of the lands as we travel.
> Also on the lower deck is the dining hall, where we will be serving lunch at midday, dinner at 7, and breakfast at 8."

- They can do whatever they want. About 20 minutes after they board, the airship will take flight.

> Outside you hear some whistles and shouts from outside the ship, and the hum of arcane energy.
> The ship lurches slightly as it casts off from the dock, and begins its journey.

- If they're near a viewport:
  > You see the elemental ring glow brightly, as the hum builds.
- Then, about 10 minutes later:

> There's a soft crackle in the air, followed by a soft hum.
> A voice sounds out all around you, which no discernable source.
> "This is your captain speaking.
> On behalf of House Lyrandar, I'd like to welcome you aboard the Cloud's Destiny, the finest ship in the skies.
> I'm Captain Morgis and my crew and I hope you enjoy your flight to Zilargo.
> Tomorrow morning at about this time we will be stopping briefly in Trolanport and then continuing on for another twenty hours or so to Korranberg."
>
> You can tell this speech is pretty well rehearsed, as it continues, this time a bit more relaxed.
>
> "Skies are clear, so we should make good time and you should have excellent views from the lower cafÃ© area.
> Speaking of views, we should be over the King's Forest momentarily.
> Most people never get to see a jungle from this angle, so consider yourselves fortunate and keep your eyes open for some of the most beautiful birds you'll ever see."

- The PCs have time to do whatever they wish.
- About an hour later, if any of them are taking in the view:

> As the airship passes over the King's Forest, you look out see the vast forest stretching out for miles in all directions.
> You can see flocks of birds, and numerous clearings and bodies of water amongst the trees far below.

- They can make a DC15 Wisdom (Perception) check:
  > In the distance, about a half mile away, you can see a large bird flying alone in the sky beneath the ship.
- About 5 minutes later, some of the passengers start to murmur, and point out the bird - wondering what it is.
  - Wisdom (Perception) check:
    - DC10 - they notice it is flying parallel with the airship's path.
    - DC15 - they can recognise it as a person riding a glidewing.
    - DC18 - they can make out a handful of similar shapes skirting the tops of the trees in the distance.
    - DC20 - these figures are on an intercept path
- Another 5 minutes later, the captain will make an announcement

> The familiar crackle and hum fills the air, as you hear the captain's voice
> "This is your captain speaking.
> It seems we are not alone in the skies this morning.
> Some of you may have seen a rider above the King's Forest.
> I don't expect any trouble, but it is standard procedure for all passengers to retire to their cabin in circumstances such as this one.
> Please return to your cabins immediately, and I will keep you updated.
> All hands on deck."

- If (/when) the PCs ignore the captain's orders and head to the upper deck, he will consider them:
  - If they are armed/armoured - he'll nod at them and tell them their aid is welcome.
  - If they are unarmed - he'll order them down to their cabins.
- As the attackers approach, the captain will make one final announcement

> You hear the captain's voice ring out across the ship one more time.
> "This is Captain Morgis.
> All passengers must remain in their cabins and lock their doors.
> Do not open your door for anyone until I announce the all-clear.'

- COMBAT
  - Friendly:
    - There are 2 guards who will fight.
    - There are 10 crew members that will do their best with their crossbows.
    - Captain Morgis is a decent enough fighter, but will be occupied with the gliders
    - [[Grilsha Stellos]] will come above deck after 2 turns and drop her form.
      - Passive Perception 15 or greater will notice:
        > You see an elderly dwarven woman running up the stairs and briefly assess the situation.
        > You watch as she pulls a feather out of a pouch at her waist, and she starts casting a spell.
        > A moment later you watch as her form starts to melt and remake itself as she begins hovering off of the ground.
        > Her body stabilises into that of a slender, human woman with auburn hair.
        > She immediately shoots into the sky, engaging the glidewing riders.
      - Everyone else:
        > You watch as an auburn haired woman flies out from below deck and into the sky, engaging with the glidewing riders.
  - Enemy:
    - Scimitar (warforged)
    - 5 warforged
    - 10 glidewing riders
  - The fight:
    - The crew will engage, and be tied up with the riders for the fight.
    - The warforged will land and immediately head for the PCs.
      - If the PCs are above deck - they'll head straight into combat.
      - Otherwise they'll head below deck and search for the PCs.
    - The halflings will flee if they see Scimitar fall.
      - The warforged will fight to the death.

## Aftermath

- Captain Morgis will not pursue any halflings
  - The Cloud's Destiny is not a warship, and he has a duty to protect his passengers.

> "This is Captain Morgis
> The danger has now passed, and passengers are free to roam the ship once more.
> We thank you for your caution, and apologise for this unexpected interruption."

- Grilsha does not know who the PCs are, nor their intentions.
  - She is not hostile to them at all.
  - Responses:
    - If questioned:
      - She says she's heading out for a holiday in Korranberg.
    - If questioned about her brother:
      - She'll express surprise that the PCs know about her family.
      - She'll dodge the question with questions about what the PCs know and why they're looking for him.
      - If pressed, she'll say that last she heard he was in sharn.
      - If pressed further, she'll say she's meeting him in Korranberg.
    - If the PCs push hard, she'll be distrusting of them, and assume they're agents of [[Calderus]].
      - She'll alter self again to disappear from the PCs as soon as she can.
- The ship will stop in Trolanport as planned, though due to the attack it will be overnight instead of a brief stop.
  - Shortly before docking in Trolanport, Morgis will make an announcement:

> "This is Captain Morgis
> Due to the unforeseen circumstances, we will remain docked at Trolanport overnight instead of just making a short stop.
> Any House Lyrandar is happy to accommodate any and all passengers who wish to disembark and proceed to Korranberg by sea.
> These services will be provided free of charge.
> We thank you for your patronage, and hope to be able serve you further."

- If Grilsha believes the PCs mean Lucan harm, she will attempt to take whatever route the PCs aren't taking.
  - This time she'll be disguised as a gnome, so the PCs will have trouble picking her out from the other passengers
- If she believes no harm is intended - then she'll gladly stay on board.
  - Even with the delay, she'll arrive in Korranberg much faster than by sea.
