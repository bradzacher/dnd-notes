# Chapter 2 - The Forgotten Forge

## Part One - Death in the Upper City

### The Bloody Bridge

- Dalannan Tower in Menthis
- Pouring with rain.

> Curtains of water fall from the sky as you traverse the labyrinthine walkways of Sharn.
> The stone and wooden paths wind around and between the towers and spires high above the ground, forming a complex
> latticework that can be very confusing on evenings such as this.
> The rain falls hard, running off higher walkways and balconies in drenching waves, making it difficult to see much
> more than a few feet ahead of you. The distant glow of everbright lanterns, barely visible in the soaking gloom,
> does little to light the paths on this warm, wet evening.

- DC18 Wisdom (Perception) check to see the body and the figure fleeing over the side of the bridge
- If someone succeeds, read:

> You spot two figures in a dark cloaks moving quietly through the rain on the sky bridge ahead.
> They seem to be avoiding the dim pools of light cast by the everbright lanterns, preferring to stay to the shadows.
> Lightning flashes, and you see a shape on the stone floor of the bridge in the brief illumination.
> The figures quickly reach the railing of the sky bridge, then slip over the barrier and disappears into the
> darkness and the rain.

- As players approach the bridge

> The sky bridge ahead spans the distance between platforms attached to the sides of two different towers — Dalannan
> Tower and the Kelsa Spire.
> A body lies on the floor of the bridge, and you can see a mixture of rain and blood pooling around it.
> A leather satchel, still clutched tightly in the body's hand, lies in the expanding puddle of water and gore.

- The body is that of Bonal Geldem, a professor from Morgrave University
  - DC 10 Wisdom (Medicine) check reveals he is dead, succumbing to large, messy and deep cuts - likely caused by a large weapon.
- Players don't have an opportunity to do much of an investigation just yet, as Cutter and Smasher are about attack from underneath the bridge!
  - DC 15 Wisdom (Perception) check to hear the sound of the Warforged climbing under the bridge.
    - Failure means the character will be surprised.
  - Cutter and Smasher fight with anger against the "meat bags".
  - During the battle, PCs can hear a few shouts from nearby towers:
    - "Hey, stop that!"
    - "Call the Watch!"
    - "Murder! They're murdering that man!"
  - Cutter's final messenger activates if she dies, sending news of her failure to her superior, Sabre.
  - After **4** rounds of combat, if Cutter is still alive, she makes for the satchel and attempts to flee.
- Investigating the body:
  - DC 10 Intelligence (Investigation) check reveals:
    - Identification papers in his pocket:
      - Bonal Geldem, Provost of the School of Pre-Galifar Studies, Morgrave University
    - Coin pouch with 2gp, 10sp
    - Satchel
      - obviously well made and stylish,
      - contains quills and inks,
      - six blank sheets of fine Karrnathi paper,
      - a wrapped apple,
      - Bonal's journal.

> This small journal, measuring about 3 inches by 6 inches and 1 inch thick, has a cover of dark brown leather with
> strands of mithral thread woven in a strange pattern.
> It bears no title, just the mithral-thread icon on the front cover.
> Inside, every page is blank, but the sheets have a strange feel; they don't seem to be paper or leather,
> but something not readily identifiable.

- Players can recognise the pattern on the cover as the same as the old Cannith sigil that they saw at the excavation site.
  - The journal is extremely resistant to damage, including fire.
  - Any attempts to write in the journal using ordinary means fail
    - Ink, charcoal, chalk, and other normal writing mediums simply slide off the blank sheets.
  - The journal radiates a strong aura of Illusion magic.

### The City Watch

> Three guards wearing the green-and-black studded leather of Sharn's City Watch, emerge from the rain-drenched night.
> The leader, a powerfully built bald dwarf with a close-cropped beard, steps forward, leveling his crossbow in your direction.
> The small ball of arcane light, hovering just above and behind his left shoulder, illuminates the area.
> To each side, the two human watch members stand with halberds at the ready.
> "Olladra's bloody nose!" the dwarf curses. "By order of the Watch, drop your weapons and explain yourselves!"

- The city watch shows up a few minutes after combat ends.
  - The officers demand to know what's going on.
    - The lead officer is named Sergeant Dolom.
  - Dolom demands that the adventurers comply with his orders.
    - If they refuse or try to flee, Dolom and his companions attack.
    - They call for additional members of the Watch to hurry to their side.
      - 1d4 members of the Watch show up every 3 rounds until Dolom calls them off or the PCs surrender or are defeated.
  - Players can attempt to explain the situation:
    - DC15 Charisma (Persuasion) check to convince them of their innocence.
      - The players have advantage if they mention the witnesses.
      - The check becomes a DC10 if the players show their Writs from [[Germaine Vilroy]].
      - Beating the DC by 0-5:
        - Dolom accepts that the PCs were trying to help, although he encourages them to leave such matters to the Watch.
      - Beating the DC by 6+:
        - Dolom is impressed with the heroism and bravery displayed by the PCs.
        - He rewards them 2gp each for assisting the Watch and becomes a friendly contact within the Watch.
- After the characters leave the bridge, a cloaked figure approaches them.
  - This Kibbil - the attendant of [[Lady Elaydren Vown d'Cannith]]

### The Broken Anvil

> The sign above the door carries a carving of a shattered anvil, as well as the familiar blink dog emblem of House Ghallanda.
> As you enter the establishment, the inside is warm and welcoming - and much better appointed than you expected given the tavern's location.
> Looking around the place appears to be mostly empty - there's just two patrons, and a halfling woman behind the bar.
> As you enter, you hear the halfling say to the table "My Lady, your guests have arrived"
> The human female in the dark blue cloak has delicate features, dark blue eyes, and sleek black hair bound with silver and turquoise ornaments.
> She wears a signet ring of House Cannith on her right ring finger and speaks in a soft but clear voice.
> "Thank you for coming. We have important business to discuss that relates to the unfortunate death of Bonal Geldem. Please, sit down."

- This is [[Lady Elaydren Vown d'Cannith]], a scion of house Cannith.
  - She greets the PCs, and offers to get the PCs food and drink, but doesn't waste time getting to business:

> I have been working with Provost Geldem to recover a family heirloom. We were to meet earlier tonight, but as you know, he never made it.
> I learned from the Watch what had transpired, and so sent one of my men to track you down.
> The heirloom, according to family legends, was locked away in a foundry that dates back to pre-Galifar Sharn.
> Poor Bonal believed he discovered the location of the foundry in an ancient House Cannith journal.
> I was going to fund an expedition to go to the site, but without Bonal...
> Perhaps you would be willing to recover the heirloom for me. For a generous reward, of course.

- Allow the PCs to ask some questions if they wish:
  - What is the pay?
    - "I offer you **one thousand gold pieces** and the good will of my house if you recover the heirloom and return it to me."
    - A DC15 Charisma (Persuasion) check can convince her to increase this to 1250gp.
    - She will pay the characters 100gp each up front - and offers no more.
  - What is she seeking?
    - "The relic I seek is an adamantine plate in the shape of a seven-pointed star about the size of your hand. It has no special power by itself, but is an ancient schema—a piece of a pattern used by the Cannith artificers of old to craft unusual items."
  - Who killed Bonal Geldem?
    - "A servant of the [[Lord of Blades]]. The warforged prophet wants the schema for his own dark purposes"
    - How do you know it was the [[Lord of Blades]]?
      - "We intercepted an agent of the Lord of Blades attempting to break into a secure House facility. After a certain amount of persuasion, he admitted that he was seeking the lost foundry and who his master was. I would not be surprised if the Lord of Blades has other agents in the city."
  - Who do you work for?
    - "I work for Baron Jorlanna d'Cannith of Aundair, and serve House Cannith West"
    - Why don't you seek the help of the local house?
      - "House Cannith's leadership has been disjointed since the destruction of Cyre. I am loyal to the leader of my portion of the family, which operates out of Aundair. I have nothing against the Sharn-based family, but I am here to further the efforts of Baron Jorlanna d'Cannith of Aundair"
  - Are there any dangers we should be aware of?
    - "Other than the Lord of Blades, who may have other agents seeking the schema, who knows what lurks in the hidden places beneath the city? Now that I think about it, Bonal did say that he would definitely need to bring fire on the expedition. I wonder what he meant? Anyway, I urge caution, but I am completely confident that you can handle anything you may encounter in your search."
    - If the PCs tell her about the final messenger, she looks troubled, then says that the Lord of Blades most definitely is aware of the situation.
- Once the players agree, she asks them for the journal.
  - "The location of the lost foundry is deep within the Dorasharn Tower, 57 levels below the tower’s present-day sewer system."
  - "This map shows the way to reach the sewers of the Dorasharn Tower. Somewhere beyond the E-213 Valve Cluster you'll find a sealed door with the same mark as the one on Bonal's journal. Open the seal, and the tunnel beyond will take you to the long-forgotten level far below, where the foundry resides."

#### Secrets

- [[Lady Elaydren Vown d'Cannith]] secretly works for [[Merrix d'Cannith]]
  - She doesn't know why he wants the schema - only that he does
- Elaydren knows that the item they retrieved from Coal is a Docent.
  - She can tell the following facts:
    - It is ancient - hundreds of thousands of years.
    - It was made by the giants of Xen'Drik.
    - Cannith artificers have never been able to replicate it completely.
    - Because of this, they are _incredibly_ rare.
    - It is used in creations such as the Warforged Titans.
  - She will not press the PCs for information about how they got it (for now), as she feels she's already asked a lot of them

## Part Two - Into the Depths

### Malleon's Gate

- The players only know that the entrance is within Dorasharn Tower - they don't know how to find it.
- As they spend some time exploring the streets of Dorasharn:

> The streets of Dorasharn Tower are lined with ramshackle apartments and filled with goblins, hobgoblins, and the occasional bugbear.
> Sharn has always had goblinoids, but they aren’t often seen in numbers like this.

- Mini-events and sights:
  - An entirely-too-lifelike statue of an angry hobgoblin warrior near the entrance of an apartment.
  - A house Orien coach sits up on bricks - its wheels (and most of its parts) stripped and stolen.
  - A minotaur holding a large piece of wood approaches you and politely asks if you have any copper to spare.
    - He's mildly persistent, but won't hang around if the PCs try to threaten/intimidate him.
  - A small, jovial crowd gathers around a goblin and a kobold that are getting ready to have an arm wrestling match. A bugbear calls for the crowd to place their bets.
    - The match will consist of a best of 3 - roll off 1d20 checks to see who wins.
    - Players can bet. Winners double their money - losers lose it all.
    - If players want to try to influence the result, they have to do it stealthily.
      - Have them roll a DC15 Dexterity (Sleight of Hand or Stealth) check (depending on what they're doing).
      - Failure will result in a bugbear in the crowd noticing their actions, and calling them out.
      - This could lead to a fist fight scuffle!
- Have the players roll Intelligence (Investigation) checks.
  - The highest rolls find just one thing of interest - a stairwell off to the side of the central square.
  - Down the stairs is a small room, about 20x20ft.
  - A goblin named Neebur has setup a tailor shop down here.
    - It's out of the way so he can have some peace and quiet from the chaos of Malleon's Gate.
    - He sells clothes sized and designed for goblins.
      - The clothes are all well made and have their own, distinctive style.
    - If any PC looks hard enough, they notice some _very_ fine (glamerweave) garments.
  - Behind the counter is an old door - the door is rusted and bolted shut.
    - If asked - Neebur will gladly tell the PCs that the door is sealed.
    - If pressed - he will invite them to try and open it if they wish, as long as they don't damage his wares.
    - DC20 Strength check to open the door.
      - The check can be made at advantage with a crowbar.
    - Inside is a foul-smelling cistern.
  - Whilst the PCs are talking to Neebur, they'll hear some heavy footfalls as a well-dressed Bugbear comes down the stairs.
    - This is Mandy - a bully and a brute.
    - A DC 10 Wisdom (Insight) check will reveal Neebur is clearly terrified of him - he stiffens as he sees the bugbear enter.
    - Mandy demands Neebur tells him about his new suits.
      - Neebur hurriedly produces a pair of bugbear-sized trousers from a rack in the corner.
      - Neebur then proceeds to plead for more time, insisting that he needs more than a few hours to craft an entire wardrobe.
    - Mandy will turn to vandalism in an attempt to motivate him.
      - Mandy doesn't care about the presence of the PCs, and will break several racks, unless the PCs intervene.
    - "Yes. I can help you with that Valve issue, but Mandy here is my most important customer. Of course. And I have to take care of him first. I'm sorry, but until he's... done. You’ll just have to wait."
