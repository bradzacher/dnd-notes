# Chapter 2 - The Forgotten Forge

## Part One - Death in the Upper City

### The Bloody Bridge

- Dalannan Tower in Menthis
- Pouring with rain.

> Curtains of water fall from the sky as you traverse the labyrinthine walkways of Sharn.
> The stone and wooden paths wind around and between the towers and spires high above the ground, forming a complex
> latticework that can be very confusing on evenings such as this.
> The rain falls hard, running off higher walkways and balconies in drenching waves, making it difficult to see much
> more than a few feet ahead of you. The distant glow of everbright lanterns, barely visible in the soaking gloom,
> does little to light the paths on this warm, wet evening.

- DC18 Wisdom (Perception) check to see the body and the figure fleeing over the side of the bridge
- If someone succeeds, read:

> You spot two figures in a dark cloaks moving quietly through the rain on the sky bridge ahead.
> They seem to be avoiding the dim pools of light cast by the everbright lanterns, preferring to stay to the shadows.
> Lightning flashes, and you see a shape on the stone floor of the bridge in the brief illumination.
> The figures quickly reach the railing of the sky bridge, then slip over the barrier and disappears into the
> darkness and the rain.

- As players approach the bridge

> The sky bridge ahead spans the distance between platforms attached to the sides of two different towers — Dalannan
> Tower and the Kelsa Spire.
> A body lies on the floor of the bridge, and you can see a mixture of rain and blood pooling around it.
> A leather satchel, still clutched tightly in the body’s hand, lies in the expanding puddle of water and gore.

- The body is that of Bonal Geldem, a professor from Morgrave University
  - DC 10 Wisdom (Medicine) check reveals he is dead, succumbing to large, messy and deep cuts - likely caused by a large weapon.
- Players don't have an opportunity to do much of an investigation just yet, as Cutter and Smasher are about attack from underneath the bridge!
  - DC 15 Wisdom (Perception) check to hear the sound of the Warforged climbing under the bridge.
    - Failure means the character will be surprised.
  - Cutter and Smasher fight with anger against the "meat bags".
  - During the battle, PCs can hear a few shouts from nearby towers:
    - "Hey, stop that!"
    - "Call the Watch!"
    - "Murder! They’re murdering that man!"
  - Cutter's final messenger activates if she dies, sending news of her failure to her superior, Sabre.
  - After **4** rounds of combat, if Cutter is still alive, she makes for the satchel and attempts to flee.
- Investigating the body:
  - DC 10 Intelligence (Investigation) check reveals:
    - Identification papers in his pocket:
      - Bonal Geldem, Provost of the School of Pre-Galifar Studies, Morgrave University
    - Coin pouch with 2gp, 10sp
    - Satchel
      - obviously well made and stylish,
      - contains quills and inks,
      - six blank sheets of fine Karrnathi paper,
      - a wrapped apple,
      - Bonal's journal.

> This small journal, measuring about 3 inches by 6 inches and 1 inch thick, has a cover of dark brown leather with
> strands of mithral thread woven in a strange pattern.
> It bears no title, just the mithral-thread icon on the front cover.
> Inside, every page is blank, but the sheets have a strange feel; they don’t seem to be paper or leather,
> but something not readily identifiable.

- Players can recognise the pattern on the cover as the same as the old Cannith sigil that they saw at the excavation site.
  - The journal is extremely resistant to damage, including fire.
  - Any attempts to write in the journal using ordinary means fail
    - Ink, charcoal, chalk, and other normal writing mediums simply slide off the blank sheets.
  - The journal radiates a strong aura of Illusion magic.

### The City Watch

> Three guards wearing the green-and-black studded leather of Sharn's City Watch, emerge from the rain-drenched night.
> The leader, a powerfully built bald dwarf with a close-cropped beard, steps forward, leveling his crossbow in your direction.
> The small ball of arcane light, hovering just above and behind his left shoulder, illuminates the area.
> To each side, the two human watch members stand with halberds at the ready.
> "Olladra's bloody nose!" the dwarf curses. "By order of the Watch, drop your weapons and explain yourselves!"

- The city watch shows up a few minutes after combat ends.
  - The officers demand to know what's going on.
    - The lead officer is named Sergeant Dolom.
  - Dolom demands that the adventurers comply with his orders.
    - If they refuse or try to flee, Dolom and his companions attack.
    - They call for additional members of the Watch to hurry to their side.
      - 1d4 members of the Watch show up every 3 rounds until Dolom calls them off or the PCs surrender or are defeated.
  - Players can attempt to explain the situation:
    - DC15 Charisma (Persuasion) check to convince them of their innocence.
      - The players have advantage if they mention the witnesses.
      - The check becomes a DC10 if the players show their Writs from [[Germaine Vilroy]].
      - Beating the DC by 0-5:
        - Dolom accepts that the PCs were trying to help, although he encourages them to leave such matters to the Watch.
      - Beating the DC by 6+:
        - Dolom is impressed with the heroism and bravery displayed by the PCs.
        - He rewards them 2gp each for assisting the Watch and becomes a friendly contact within the Watch.
