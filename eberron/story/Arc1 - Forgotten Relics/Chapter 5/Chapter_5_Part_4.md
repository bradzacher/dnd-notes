# Part 4 - The Ruin

- The ruin is 325 feet tall, and composed of solid stone with lingering spells of solidity and protection.
- The gallery level is open to the elements, made of massive columns and blocks of stone that support the upper three levels.
- The dark level has no exterior access.
- The temple and observatory levels have many windows and openings.
- If they want to climb...
  - DC18 Strength (Athletics) check to climb the side of the building.
  - Disadvantage on this check for climbing to climb past the dark level, due to the overhang.
- The doors that remain are sized for giants and show evidence that the lingering spells of protection have faded over the centuries; eroding stone and rusting iron are common.
- Except when noted otherwise (as in the gallery level), ceiling height within the ruin is 30 feet.
  - Everything in the place is sized for giants, with a few exceptions that were made for the use of their elf slaves.
  - The place should make the adventurers feel small, weak, and lost by comparison.

## Random Encounters

### Drow Warriors

- The drow are armed with distinctive weapons – three-pronged Xen'drik boomerangs and drow long knives.
- With narrow blades longer than a dagger that curve toward the tip, the drow long knife should be treated as a shortsword.
- Use one Drow Warrior for each 6th-level PC and add Balmatzoc as their leader.
- Balmatzoc is a skilled hunter, and he is the most well-travelled of the surviving drow–one of the few members of the drow community here who has been to Stormreach and understands Common, though he speaks it poorly.
- He is filled with rage at the Emerald Claw and will assume the PCs are with them unless they prove otherwise.
- If the PCs are able to do so, Balmatzoc may convince the remaining drow to coordinate with the PCs, though the drow will only consider plans that focus on vengeance against the Emerald Claw

### Emerald Claw Soldier Patrol

- The soldiers patrol the ruin, watching for threats and looking for anything that might interest their leader, Garrow.

### Cloud Apes

- A pair of cloud apes have been hiding in this area after an encounter with a patrol of Karrnathi undead, which left their companions dead.

### Karrnathi Undead Soldier Patrol

- Garrow has set these undead warriors loose to patrol the ruin for any potential threads to the Emerald Claw taskforce.

### Chimera

- A chimera has been attracted to the ruin by the chaos caused by the Emerald Claw’s arrival.

## Gallery Level

### (1) Giant Steps

> Five massive stone steps rise 50 feet to a colossal, open-air gallery capped by the oppressive weight of the ancient ruin.
> A series of 20-foot-wide, 50-foot-tall stone columns surrounds the gallery and supports the upper levels of the ruin.
> A 10-foot-wide channel cut into the stone next to the great stairs contains a far smaller staircase, providing a crumbling route for creatures more or less your own size.
>
> The carnage of a great battle litters the smaller staircase.
> Dozens of bodies are scattered across the steps.
> A few bear the distinctive militaristic uniform worn by soldiers of the Emerald Claw,
> but many more are ebony-skinned elves wearing clothing made of carapaces and strange leather.
> Scavenger birds cover the bodies, feasting on the remains.

- The EC discovered that Drow had made their home in the ruins.
- Garrow ordered the slaughter of the drow.
  - 14 EC soldiers and 4 EC skeletons died in the fight.
  - ~90 Drow died in the fight.
  - The remaining Drow fled into the jungle.
- The Drow have returned to reclaim their home.
- Amoxtli and his team are tasked with watching the front steps.
  - They are currently hiding on the gallery level.
  - The PCs can spot the Drow if scouting from above with a DC14 Wisdom (Perception) check.
- When the PCs get half-way up the stairs, the Drow will trigger the Boulder trap
  - DC14 Dexterity Save. 8d6 bludgeoning damage on a failed save and half as much on a successful one.
- Half of the drow and Amoxtli will follow the boulder down to attack.
  - The other half will throw their boomerangs down from back near the top of the stairs.
- The drow fight to the death.
  - If any are captured, the language barrier must be first overcome (the drow speak their own tongue).
  - The will tell the tale of the hateful invaders, how they attacked without provocation and burned out the drow nests.
  - The drow do not know what the invaders seek, but they assume it is some ancient secret of the temple.
  - The drow rarely enter the higher levels of the ruin, for it is best to leave the things of the ancient ones well and truly alone.

### (2) Drow Nests

> Rounded, mud-brown structures infest this portion of the great gallery, jumbled and stuck together.
> Formed of dirt, the multitude of mud tubes appears to create a series of enclosed tunnels large enough to admit human-sized creatures.
> The structures are piled one atop the other with seemingly no concern for order or ease of access.
> Many of the rounded structures are scorched and broken open, spilling blackened bones and other less easily identifiable contents onto the gallery floor.

- The drow who inhabited this ruin created their mud tube dwellings using soil and water.
  - Hardened, the mud walls and the overhanging ruin provided ample protection from the elements.
  - They were once beautifully designed with organic shapes that flowed to meet the needs of the drow.
  - Both the interior and exterior surfaces were once alive with multicolored mosses and flowering jungle plants that had been cultivated for centuries.
  - Now, those living walls have succumbed to fire – the plants are now ash and char, while the walls themselves are dried out and lifeless.
- The Emerald Claw task force burned out the nests, forcing the surviving drow to flee into the surrounding jungle.
- Now scavengers occupy the ruined dwellings, and disease is rampant.
  - For each hour a character spends exploring the nests, he or she is exposed to ash rot.
  - Upon exiting the nest, a PC must succeed on a Constitution saving throw of DC 10 + 1 per hour spent. On a failure they contract [[Ash Rot]].
