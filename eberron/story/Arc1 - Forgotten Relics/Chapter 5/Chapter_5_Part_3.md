# Part Three - Riding the Marlow

- The Marlow can cover 80 miles per day.
- At night the ship is anchored in the middle of the river with a watch set.
- The characters share a small auxiliary cargo hold for their quarters.

> Caimans, river otters, and fish of various sizes swim through the water ahead, beside, and behind the Marlow.
> Hundreds of different species of birds are visible and audible in and around the surrounding jungle.
> Every so often, a crew member points out an exotic animal eyeing the passing boat from the safety of the jungle foliage.
> Only the path that the river cuts through the emerald trees and foliage is clear—all else is a riot of leaves, branches, and strange animals.
> Occasionally, the distant sound of drums can be heard, drifting over the canopy of leaves.

- Chinxero's response about the drums:
  > It would be difficult to number the different savage tribes and races that hunt through the jungle.
  > We'd best stay clear of them, though—it is well known that most eat humans and halflings if they can catch them.

## River Encounters

- The first day on the Rachi River is spent in the cultivated region surrounding Stormreach.
  - Small villages dot the riverside every few miles.
- After the first day, they will be within the "deep jungle", and encounters are more likely.
- At the start of each day, have a player roll a d100

| Day   | Encounter? (roll d%) | Time (roll d6)     |
| ----- | -------------------- | ------------------ |
| One   | 01–10                | 1–2 day, 3–6 night |
| Two   | 01–20                | 1–3 day, 4–6 night |
| Three | 01–30                | 1–4 day, 5–6 night |
| Four  | 01–40                | 1–3 day, 4–6 night |
| Five  | 01–50                | day                |

- If an encounter occurs, roll on the following tables:

### Daytime Encounters

| d12  | Encounter       |
| ---- | --------------- |
| 1-2  | Aquatic Trolls  |
| 3    | Ettin and Ogre  |
| 4-6  | Insect Swarms   |
| 7-8  | Shambling Mound |
| 9-11 | Spiders         |
| 12   | Hydra           |

#### Aquatic Trolls

- These two trolls are adapted to life in the river.
  - They are fully amphibious, able to breathe both air and water, and have a swim speed of 30 feet.
- If anyone is fishing from the boat, they will try to pull them into the water.
  - Otherwise, they will climb aboard grab someone, and jump back into the river with their prey.

#### Ettin and Ogre

- An ogre is bathing at the edge of the river.
- An ettin sits on the bank.
- One of its heads is chatting up the ogre while the other looks bored until it sees the Marlow.
- The ettin is likely to attack in an attempt to impress the ogre with its prowess.
- The ogre may join in for fun.
- The giants can be spoken to, and it may be possible to avoid combat with them, but they only speak Giant.

#### Insect Swarms

- The jungle gets particularly hot and humid and 4 swarms of river wasps descend upon the riverboat.
- In addition to their bites, the insects reduce visibility, making navigation difficult.
- Individually, the river wasps that make up the swarms range in size from under an inch long to over three inches in length.

#### Shambling Mound

- A shambling mound will slide down the river and latch on to the side of the boat, where it will look like a large patch of vegetation that has been caught there.
- It will tag along with the boat until someone comes to attempt to dislodge it, at which point it will try to pull them into the river.
- If no one bothers it, it will sneak onto the boat at night in search of a meal.

#### Spiders

- 2 ettercaps that are hiding in the canopy above the river will drop a web across the deck of the boat and attack.
- Treat the web as a web spell, although the ettercaps do not need to concentrate upon it.
- While they attack from above, their 2 phase spider companions will step out from the ethereal plane below deck.
- The three will attempt to inject their poison into a target.
  - Once they have done so the ettercaps will try to restrain that target with their webbing and carry it off into the trees.

#### Hydra

- As the Marlow enters the hunting grounds of the hydra, the jungle noises gradually die away.
- The hydra, while frightening, is not too bright and will see the Marlow as a challenger in its territory.
- As the boat comes down the river, it will charge out from the jungle towards it, bellowing with all of its heads.

### Nighttime Encounters

| d12  | Encounter     |
| ---- | ------------- |
| 1-4  | Will-o'-Wisps |
| 5-6  | Green Hag     |
| 7-10 | Hliska Swarm  |
| 9-12 | Hunting Cats  |

#### Will-o'-Wisps

- A pair of will-o'-wisps will attempt to lure whomever is on watch away while the Marlow is anchored at night.
- While they do, a second pair will slip aboard from the opposite direction.

#### Green Hag

- A green hag attempts to lure people off the boat where her pet, a giant crocodile, waits hidden in the dark water.

#### Hliska Swarm

- 2d4 swarms of hliska (large rodents with color-changing camouflaged fur native to Xen'drik will slip aboard the boat and attempt to gorge themselves on the riverboat's food stores.

#### Hunting Cats

- A displacer beast leads a pride of jungle cats.
- Their hunting party will leap to the boat at night, looking for prey.
- In addition to the displacer beast, the hunting party consists of two jungle cats.
- The jungle cats are large, six-legged felines with green and brown striped fur.
  - Treat them as saber-toothed tigers.

## The Giant Hands

> You reach a turn in the Rachi River.
> At a place where the land rises up from the vegetation-strewn banks,
> you see giant hands of stone reaching out of the rocky soil toward the sky.
> These ancient monoliths suggest that you are nearing the site of the fourth schema's resting place.
>
> On the bank of the river near the giant's left hand you see a small air-skiff floating about 20 feet in the air.
> A rope ladder hangs over the side and a line is spiked into the ground.

- DC10 Wisdom (Perception) check to see two guards standing on the skiff.
- The guards have already spotted the adventurers, and know they don't stand a chance.
  - They will try to talk to the adventurers to delay them whilst the 3rd guard attempts to warn Garrow.
    - DC 15 Wisdom (Perception) check to spot the 3rd guard sneaking into the ruins
- Questions the guards can answer
  - Who Are You?

  - Who Is Your Leader?
    > "The great and powerful Garrow leads us."
  - Is Your Leader a Vampire?
    > (After a short pause) "Yes, a powerful vampire." (This is a lie.)
