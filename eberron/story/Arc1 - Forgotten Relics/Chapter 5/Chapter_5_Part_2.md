# Part Two - From Here to There

## The Final Briefing

- The PCs can return to Elaydren's house in 2 hours.

> As you approach Lady Elaydren's townhouse you hear a loud banging followed the sound of shattering glass.
> As you spring around the corner, you hear a portly dwarf launch into a series of dwarfish curses towards a human hanging out of the window.
> On the ground you see the shattered remnants of a window as a goblin rushes over dragging a large bin and a broom behind them.

- DC 15 Passive Perception will notice that none of the labourers are wearing House Cannith livery.
  - DC 15 Intelligence (Investigation) or Wisdom (Insight) check will let a PC infer that Elaydren is probably hiding the attack from the House.
  - If questioned - Elaydren will be a bit defensive, but will quickly concede the point.
    - She didn't want news of her failure to reach her Baron.
    - At least, not until she had a chance to set in motion actions to correct it.
- Elaydren seems relieved to see the party.

> I have secured you passage on a new form of transportation recently developed by House Cannith,
> It is called an undersea ship, for it travels secretly beneath the waves.
> Three such vehicles have been constructed.
> We built them for various intelligence agencies, but only one such group has had the vision to purchase one of the ships now that the Last War has ended.
> The other two remain in Cannith hands.
> Take this letter of passage to [[Byam]], in the Grayflood district.
> He can be found in the vicinity of the Stone Docks.
> He will make sure you get safely to [[Stormreach]] and back again.

- Let them ask any questions

> The undersea ship will take you to Stormreach, the trading town located on the northern coast of Xen'drik.
> You might be able to pick up the Emerald Claw task force's trail in or around Stormreach.
> If that doesn't seem to be working, you should instead head directly for the ruins.
> Kedran's notes place the ancient site about four hundred miles up the Rachi River.
> Here is the clue from Kedran's notes to finding the site once you reach that stretch of the river:
>
> "At the turn in the Rachi River,
> where the land rises and the hands of stone reach for the sky,
> look toward the giant's left hand for guidance to the schema's resting place."
>
> A bit vague for me, but it's what we've got to go on.

- Let them ask any questions.

> Before I forget, as promised - here is your advance payment.
> Collect the four schemas and the creation pattern, return them to me, and an equal amount will be yours on your return.
> Good luck, and may the fortunes of the Houses and the Nations smile upon you.

- She hands each of the PCs a sack filled with 1,500gp worth of small gems.

## Sea Dart

- Byam can be found easily by asking around for him
- When found, he is playing a game of dice with some sailors
  - He'll ask them to wait while he finishes the game and collects his winnings
- If they show him the letter of passage, he'll lead the way to a warehouse set back in the docks.

> The gnome with the short, dark hair and colorful speech leads you into the warehouse.
> Inside, hidden from view, a sunken pool contains a strange-looking vessel.
> It looks superficially like an airship that has fallen into the water, complete with an elemental binding ring.
> However, the binding ring contains violently spinning water instead of the airy or fiery torus normally seen on airships.
> The craft's shape seems strangely thin and elongated.
> Moreover, every compartment is sealed inside the hull.
> Several gnome crew members are in the process of transferring cargo crates into an open hatchway on top of the craft.
> "This is the Sea Dart, my friends, and I am its captain, Byam of the ocean depths!"

- Byam doesn't know of the mission - just that the PCs need to get to Xen'drik ASAP.
- Let them ask whatever questions (whilst the gnomes load up the rest of the cargo)

> The Sea Dart isn't really made for this many people, nor people of your stature, so it'll be a bit cramped.
> But we'll get you there fast as we can.
> Lady Elaydren told me you need to get to Stormreach with the utmost haste.
> Almost all sea captains plot courses around the teeth.
> The waters are treacherous for normal ships, and there are many dangers hiding in the waters.
> But I've navigated the waters many times now - so I know of a route that could cut a day and a half off the trip.

## Danger at Sea

- On the second day of the trip, Captain Byam calls the PCs to the observation blister to see an interesting sight:

> Beyond the clear dome of the observation blister, a breathtaking vista reveals itself in startling hues of phosphorescent color.
> Thousands of glowing fish, some in schools, some alone, flit through the dark water.
> Great columns of stone, painted in luminescent yellows and greens, punch up from the darkness below and extend toward the surface, slowly narrowing as they reach upward.
> Some of the columns are only tens of feet across, but those farther away in the hazing distance could be far, far broader, perhaps supporting small islets of rock on the surface.
> Captain Byam says, "The Teeth, as seen from a different perspective. Beautiful, don't you think?"

- DC 18 Wisdom (Perception) Check to get this text:
  > An enormous dark shape moves through the water toward you.
  > It comes closer, and you see a streamlined body with a triangular fin atop its back, a toothy maw set well under its long snout, and a tail shaped like a crescent moon.

> The Sea Dart rocks violently as though something large and powerful has crashed into it.
> Perhaps maybe the vessel has hit one of the stone columns that rise like rocky trees through the dark water all around you.
> From somewhere, you hear the sound of dripping water as the gnome crew members begin to curse and shout.

- Have each character make a DC16 Dexterity saving throw.
  - Anyone that made the above perception check can choose to brace themselves and do a Strength saving throw instead.
  - Anyone that fails a check take 2d6 bludgeoning damage - successful checks take half damage.
- Anyone that made the perception check AND are trained in either Nature or Animal Handling can make a check DC14.
  - On a success they notice the shark is much larger than usual, and appears to be covered in markings.
  - A high enough roll deduces that this shark has been magebred.

## Rise, Rise

> "Captain!" one gnome crew member calls. "The binding ring has been damaged!"
> "Blast that overgrown sardine's misshapen fin!" Byam shouts, anger and tension fighting for dominance in his tone.
> "Get us to the surface before the elemental gets free and we're stuck in these cursed waters! Rise, rise!"

- Byam adjusts the view in the observation blister so that the crew can keep an eye on the shark.
- It appears to follow the ship a while, before disappearing beyond the range of the lights and into the darkness of the sea.

> Byam turns to you.
> "Once we reach the surface, the crew and I can examine the damage and make repairs.
> Shouldn't delay us more than a couple of hours, Wise Aureon willing."

- Let them PCs do whatever.

> It's a tense few minutes as the sound of dripping water slowly grows louder.
> You can feel the water starting to pool a bit at your feet.

- Let the PCs do whatever.

> You feel the ship lurch as the engines groan a bit.
> Byam flips the viewport around a few times before you hear him curse in Gnomish.
> "All right, crew," Byam shouts above the increasingly louder sound of dripping water
> "we're going to have to take a swim and cut the Sea Dart free."
> You watch as four of the gnomes shout in agreement and head for the rear of the ship.
> Byam turns to you he says "Any help you can provide will be much appreciated."

- There are 12 potions of deep sea diving.
- The airlock can just barely fit two medium creatures, and takes two rounds to cycle.
- The shark will appear again 2 rounds after a creature exits the airlock.
- There are 4 places that will need to be cut free.
  - It takes 2 actions to cut the net.
- Make all PCs in the water make a Wisdom (Perception) check -- DC18.
  > At the edge of the light well created by the Sea Dart's external lights you can just barely make out a shape.
  > Best you can tell - it's a vaguely humanoid shape.
  > As you notice it - it seems to slink backwards into the darkness beyond your vision.
- Combat Notes:
  - Swimming is difficult terrain unless someone has swimming speed
  - When making a melee weapon attack, a creature that doesn't have a swimming speed has disadvantage on the attack roll unless the weapon is:
    - a dagger, javelin, shortsword, spear, or trident.
  - A ranged weapon attack automatically misses a target beyond the weapon's normal range.
    - Even against a target within normal range, the attack roll has disadvantage unless the weapon is:
      - a crossbow, a net, or a weapon that is thrown like a javelin (including a spear, trident, or dart).
  - Creatures and objects that are fully immersed in water have resistance to fire damage.

## Island Encounter

> The Sea Dart breaks the surface and gently comes to rest beside a more or less flat-topped stone outcropping.
> Other such outcroppings jut from the water, though most of the nearest ones are jagged or domed.
> "This is as good a place as any," Byam declares. "Let's disembark and make repairs."

- About a half hour afterwards, the sahuagin will attack
- The Sahuagin Shark Keeper, a Sahuagin Priestess, and 5 Sahuagin Coral Smashers will rise from the water.
  - They will not immediately attack, though they have their weapons drawn and at the ready.
  - If the PCs can figure out how to talk to them, they can attempt to negotiate.
    - It will require a gift to even be able to make a Charisma (Persuasion) check.
    - If they give a gift worth at least 500gp that includes an "exotic" item (like a magical item).
    - DC 18 on the check
- The crew will not get involved, and will try to focus and work hurriedly to fix the ship.
- It will take a total of 2h to fix the ship.
- Afterwards they will head back on the sea to Stormreach.
- The remainder of the journey will take 2 days.

## Stormreach

> As the Sea Dart breaches the surface near the shore, you take in the sight of the afternoon sun and the sky.
> As you look to the north, you can see the city in all of its glory.
> Stormreach rises over the harbor, the only apparent evidence of civilization along this otherwise jungle coastline.
> Great stone buildings form the foundation of the trade city, though all manners of smaller wood structures fill in the gaps between the large structures.
> A stout stone wall surrounds the city, and a complex series of docks and wharfs connect the city to the sea.

- Because the Sea Dart is a secret that House Cannith wishes to preserve, Byam sets the adventurers on land about a half a mile down the coast.
- Once Byam secures the undersea ship and hides it down the coast, the adventurers are free to disembark.
  - Byam indicates that he will wait for 30 days before declaring the adventurers lost and returning across the Thunder Sea toward Sharn.
    > "Return before that time, and the Sea Dart will carry you home," Byam says. "Take too long, and you're on your own."

> "Slip into Stormreach by means of the docks," Byam advises.
> "These travel papers indicate that you arrived aboard the House Lyrandar galleon Strong Wind and that you are part of an expedition from Morgrave University.
> Just don't reveal any of this where anyone from the expedition can hear you --
> they probably won't go along with your story, since they don't know you from the King of Q'barra.
> Good luck."

- Byam gives the adventurers the traveling papers and a letter of credit with the House Cannith seal.

> "In case you need to acquire transportation into the jungle," Byam says.
> "You can use the credit at the House Cannith enclave, and **only** at the enclave, and **only** for transport."

- The city docks lead immediately into the city markets.

> A single canal bisects the market ward, and the wide bridge that crosses it is crowded with permanent shop fronts and hastily erected stalls.
> You hear the merchants proclaiming the quality and superiority of their wares.
> You see livestock, sweetmeats, timber, silver, pearls, furs, crystals, vellum and pens, weaponry, and a host of additional goods.
>
> The street on either side of the canal is choked with carts, temporary and permanent storefronts.
> Over it all you hear the conversation of hundreds of people buying and selling all manner of things.
> Dancers, jugglers, fire-eaters, puppeteers, and purported sorcerers peddle their talents to anyone with coin and a modicum of patience.

## Seeking The Emerald Claw

- The PCs can attempt to just ask around about the Emerald Claw.
  - If they do, have one PC make a Charisma (Persuasion) check, and the same or another PC make an Intelligence (Investigation) check.
  - Results depending on their roll below:

| Cha  | Int   | Result                                                                                                   |
| ---- | ----- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 0-14 | 0-14  | After 2d4 hours, the PCs learn nothing of use.                                                           |
| 15+  | 0-14  | After 1d4+1 hours, helpful locals suggest that the PCs ask around the docks or Lyrandar docking tower.   |
| 0-14 | 15-19 | After 1d4 hours, the PCs learn that soldiers with insignia of the Emerald Claw were spotted              |
|      |       | (roll 1d6) 1-4 in the Temple District, 5-6 near the docks.                                               |
| 15+  | 20+   | After 1d4 hours, the PCs learn that soldiers with the insignia of the Emerald Claw were traveling with a |
|      |       | warforged and that they were asking about a group from Morgrave University.                              |
| 20+  | 20+   | 1 hour - "They headed up the Rachi River, maneuvering their airship between the trees.                   |
|      |       | It was a sight to see! I doubt anyone'll ever see them again.                                            |
|      |       | I hear they were on the trail of some treasure, something they wouldn't name.                            |
|      |       | Even talked for a while with the leader of the Morgrave expedition."                                     |

- 1 hour of asking around the Airship docking tower, A DC10 Charisma (Persuasion) check will reveal that the Emerald Claw were seen embarking on an airship a day ago.
- 1 hour of asking around the Temple District will reveal that soldiers wearing Emerald Claw insignia were spotted at the Temple of the Blood of Vol
- 1d4 hours of asking around near the docks will reveal that soldiers wearing Emerald Claw insignia were spotted outside the Wavecrest Tavern a few days ago.
- If the combined time the PCs spend exceeds 5 hours, then move on to the "Asking too Many Questions" encounter

### Muroni

- Muroni is an elf, and follower of the draconic prophecy.
- She arrived more than a month ago at the behest of her master.
- Whilst the PCs are asking around, Muroni will approach them.

> I am a simple scholar who follows the Draconic Prophecy to find deeper meaning in the world.
> The Prophecy speaks of great events about to occur her in Xen'drik, events that will revolve around you.
> Allow me to witness these events, and I will aid you in any way that I can.

- Information she'll give if pressed:
  - Her master is the great silver dragon Vuulaytherus of the Chamber.
  - Her master's study of the Prophecy foretold that adventurers in league with House Cannith would arrive in Xen'drik.
    - His interpretation of the passages said that great things would happen.
  - The passages of the Prophecy were found written in veins of silver and gold deep within the Endworld Mountains.
    - The Endworld Mountains are a mountain range that separate Q'barra from the Talenta Plains.
  - Her master sent her to bear witness to the unfolding of these great events.
  - Afterwards she is to return to Vuulaytherus and report back, so that he may better understand and interpret the Prophecy.
- Muroni knows absolutely nothing about the Emerald Claw, Garrow, or the Warforged force.

### Morgrave Expedition

- The expedition from Morgrave University arrived on the Strong Wind a few days ago.
- Led by Provost Baris Kaven.
  - The expedition includes about a dozen students and two guides.
  - This is a teaching expedition, meaning that the group won’t be exploring any new sites.
    - Instead, it will work in a secured site near Stormreach that is relatively safe.
- The expedition can be found at the following locations:
  - During the day, they must walk an hour into the jungle and find them at the ruins.
  - During the evening:
    - The students are at a boarding house not far from where the Strong Wind is docked during the evenings.
    - The Provost will be at the Wavecrest Tavern.
      - DC14 Charisma (Persuasion) check at the tavern or boarding house will reveal this fact.
- If the PCs ask around at the tavern, the patrons will reveal (with a DC14 Charisma (Persuasion) check) that:
  - The Provost has been seen talking to a warforged and a half-elf the other night.
- When questioned, the Provost will be "indifferent" to the PCs.
  - They must make him warm up to them by being friendly.
  - They can also make him friendly by mentioning Provost Bonal Geldem's name with a DC12 Charisma (Persuasion) check.
    - Geldem and Kaven were friends and colleagues.
  - The Provost doesn't know too much about the Emerald Claw:
    > I spoke with a portly dwarf and his warforged friend yesterday.
    > They could be the ones you seek.
    > They wanted to know the lay of the land between here and a spot some 400 miles inland.
    > I told them if they follow the river, they'd be safer than trying to cut through the jungle.
    > The warforged called itself Falchion, and the dwarf introduced himself as Rarwog.
  - Kaven will point the PCs towards Chinxero in case they want to head downstream.

### House Lyrandar Docking Tower

- Falconer’s Spire towers over the northern edge of the Marketplace and is clearly visible from almost anywhere in the city.
- The half-elf tower master, Calynden d'Lyrandar, is a battle-hardened woman with dark red hair.
  - She has no time nor patience for foolish questions.
  - A 20gp bribe will loosen her tongue.
    - She'll reveal that Captain Codiane d'Lyrandar took an expedition south about a day ago.
    - The clients consisted of some humans, dwarves and warforged.

### Blood of Vol Temple

- The priest, a half-orc named Jheraan, will freely tell the PCs everything he knows.

> I met Garrow, a vampire, about a day ago.
> He came in with another creature called Surthain.
> I know not what Surthain was, but I do could see that they are some form of undead or demon.
> They came asking if I could refer them to anyone that knew about the jungle and the ruins within.
> I personally know nothing, but I pointed them to the Morgrave University expedition.

- Surthain is a Bodak.
- He will not admit he knows how to contact Surthain, as he does not want to incriminate himself.
  - The PCs can insight check to get a sense of this.
  - Jheraan is terrified of Surthain, and needs reassurance that he will be safe.
  - DC15 Charisma (Persuasion) check will convince Jheraan to (reluctantly) contact Surthain.

### House Cannith Enclave

- Grocror d'Cannith at the enclave will receive the PCs and accept their papers.
- He will take their credit, and give them a document.

> Speak with Chinxero - you can find him down at the his riverboat at the docs on the Rachi River.
> This document charters his services to take you downstream.

## Asking too Many Questions

- Surthain is on the lookout for the PCs.

> A small human girl walks up to you and hands you a rolled up piece of parchment.
> "This is for you mister!"
> She turns and runs off into the crowd, and is gone as quickly as she arrived.
> As you unroll the parchment, you see deep red text scrawled on it.
> "I answer asks for gold. I Surthain. Meet now. Xaponath Lane. Old Quarter."

- The courier's name is Samna, and she completed the task purely out of fear.
- The address leads to a dead-end alley filled with shadows and protected from the sun.
- Surthain and two zombies will attack the PCs.
- On Surthain's body is the "Dagger of Betrayal"

## The Riverboat

- Chinxero is easy enough to find. He is near his ship - the Marlow.
  - He is a grizzled, wiry-looking human with a hint of Orcish blood.
- He balks when he hears how far up the river they want to go (400 miles).
  - It's going to take at least 5 days, and be very dangerous

> "Too far," Chinxero says.
> "Too far and too dangerous.
> Besides, I have other runs to make, schedules to keep.
> Find another charter. Leave me be."

- It will take a DC20 Charisma (Persuasion) check to convince him.
  - Before the roll they can gain +1 to their roll for each 100gp they offer.
  - Suggesting that this could be beneficial to his business (expanding it south, getting access to new trade goods, etc.) adds +4.
  - For each point the roll fails, Chinxero will demand 200gp.
  - Threatening Chinxero with violence or failing a Charisma (Intimidation) or Charisma (Deception) check will give the PCs disadvantage on the Charisma (Persuasion) check.
- Muroni offers to pay Chinxero to make the journey, up to 400gp - if the characters refuse to pay.
- Chinxero will be ready to leave in 12 hours.
