# Part 4 - The Mournland

## Getting There

- Whitehearth is around 50 miles from them - Failin can show them their location on the map and they can get a pretty accurate reckoning of this.
  - By cart - it's about a 4 hour journey (the land cart moves at a top speed of 15mph).
    - 1h to get to the mist
    - 1h to get through the mist
    - 2h to get to Whitehearth
  - By foot - it's about a 3 day journey at a standard rate (24 miles per day).
    - 1 day to get to the mist.
    - 0.5 days to get through the mist.
    - 1.5 days to get to whitehearth.
- Convincing Failin to take them will require some convincing.
  - They may make a Charisma (Persuasion) check. If their result is:
    - Less than 10:
      - Failin will take them to the edge of the mist and no further.
      - He will not budge. He will not risk his life.
    - 10-14:
      - Cost is 1000gp.
      - He will take them through the mist and an hour into the mournland and no further.
    - Greater than 15-22:
      - The cost is reduced by 50gp per point over 14.
    - 23:
      - Cost is 1000gp.
      - He will take them to Whitehearth and will leave them there.
    - Greater than 23:
      - Reduce the cost by 50gp per point over 23.

## The Dead-Grey Mist

> The wall of roiling mist rises ahead of you, appearing solid and ephemeral at the same time.
> It's an eerie sight up close, and it gives you an unsettled feeling in the pit of your stomach.

- Let the PCs talk for a bit and figure out any logistics before entering.
  - If by foot:
    - They need to declare a marching order.
    - Make it clear that they can tell this fog is thick and will obscure visibility, so they should plan accordingly.
- When they enter the mist:

> Passing into the cloying mist is like entering an alien plane of existence.
> The background din of the wind and wildlife that you've listened to over the last few days quickly becomes quiet, and then silent.

- If by cart:
  > The sound of the cart is a strange, muffled rumble.
  > It sounds altogether off as well - as if the elemental is protesting the journey.
- If by foot:
  > The sound of your footsteps is muffled and barely audible.

> The air feels thick and heavy in your lungs, and every breath takes laborious effort as even full lung feels half.
> The daylight is muted and diffused through the shifting layers of vapor - it's impossible to tell where the sun is the sky.
> Not that you can see the sky - visibility is exceptionally poor as you're barely able to see more than 10 feet ahead of you.
> The place has a narrow, ominous feel to it.
> A feeling of isolation and growing dread builds within you as move deeper into the mist.

- Travelling by cart
  - Even though the elemental protests - it's direct connection to the land makes it an straightforward journey.
- Travelling by foot
  - The base journey will be slow and difficult - it will take at least 6 hours to traverse.
  - The PCs will need to make some Wisdom (Survival) checks:
    - Less than 10:
      - The PCs get lost for 1d3+1 hours and emerge on the wrong side of the mist (the same side they started on)
      - They must begin their journey anew.
    - 10-14:
      - The PCs get lost for 1d3+1 hours, and must roll another survival (reduce all DCs by 5 for this roll).
    - 15-19:
      - The PCs get lost for 1d3+1 hours, but emerge on the other side.
    - DC20
      - The PCs are able to get through without issue.
  - If the PCs spend more than 8 hours in the mist, they will take 1 point of exhaustion upon emerging.

> Ahead of you the mist starts to thin, and you start to make out something other than dull the grey that's filled your vision.
> The mist gives way to a desolate, barren landscape.
> The ground is cracked and broken, and in some places it has fused into jagged glass.
> Few plants grow in this region, and those that do appear to be twisted and dangerous.
> There's an all around strange feeling in the air - it just feels off.
> Looking up the mist looms low in the sky - it's hard to gauge the distance, but it only looks to be a hundred or so feet above you.

- If it's night time when they exit
  > The land is near pitch-black.
  > Outside the mist - the moons illuminated the landscape.
  > But inside - no moonlight penetrates the ceiling of mist.
  - Rules wise - there is no light at night. Characters without darkvision will need to provide their own
- If it's day time
  > The land is bathed in a twilight.
  - Rules wise - nothing, but it's eerie.
- Anyone with the ability to cast a spell:
  > You feel an odd tingling and prickling on your skin.
  > The magic in the air feels both unreliable, and unpredictable.
- When they exit the mist, and at the start of each following day - have one of the PCs roll on the following table.
  - Describe the effect if possible, but don't don't tell them the exact rule.

| --- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 1   | Healing spells are impeded here. Any spell that restores hit points does so as if it were cast at a level one lower than the spell slot expended. A spell cast using a 1st-level slot restores no hit points.                     |
| 2   | A character who casts a spell must make a Constitution saving throw against the character’s own spell save DC. On a failed save, the character takes psychic damage equal to the spell’s level and gains one level of exhaustion. |
| 3   | Any Medium humanoid that dies in the area reanimates as a zombie at the start of its next turn. The zombie is under the DM's control.                                                                                             |
| 4   | The area is affected by a silence spell.                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| 5   | Each creature that enters the area is affected by an enlarge/reduce spell, with an equal chance for each effect. The effect lasts until the creature leaves the area.                                                             |
| 6   | The pull of gravity is lessened. Creatures can jump twice the normal distance in any direction, and everything effectively weighs half its actual weight.                                                                         |
| 7   | All creatures are linked to every other creature in the area as if by the telepathy spell.                                                                                                                                        |
| 8   | A creature that casts a spell of 1st level or higher in the area rolls on the [Wild Magic Surge table](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/phb/classes#WildMagicSurgeTable).                                                        |

## Travelling Through the Mournland

- Travel through the mournland is pretty straightforward.

## Field of Bodies

- They eventually pass a crest and see a vast field of bodies stretching ahead of them.
  - The field of bodies appears to stretch on for miles in all directions
  - The bodies all appear to have died recently.
    - (no check required) The wounds on the bodies are fresh
    - Some of the wounds are even still weeping blood.
    - Any undead detection reveals nothing - everything is dead.
  - The livery of the bodies is easy to pick out - the colours of both the Brelish and Cyran armies are present.
- PCs can easily deduce that this is the remains of a battle from before the Mourning.
  - If the players don't remember - remind them that the Mourning was **_years_** ago.
- The battlefield is also littered with the remains of destroyed seige engines.
  - Large outcroppings of wood which block visibility.
- Features:
  - Sound
    - The scene is eerily silent.
  - Smell:
    - No scent of death or decay is discernible in the air, despite the number of bodies scattered across the field.
- As the PCs wander through the field, around 200 feet ahead of them, a huge form lumbers from behind the remains of a seige engine.
  - This is a cadaver collector.
  - A large, hulking warforged standing 15 feet tall strolls out.
  - Its body is covered in long, sharp spikes.
  - Impaled on some of these spikes are a number of bodies.
  - It slowly wanders the battlefield, stopping regularly to inspect and turn over some of the bodies.
  - The spikes look sharp - and the armour looks thick.
    - It looks like it would be a difficult fight.
    - It's CR14 - so it definitely would be deadly.
  - It mostly ignores the PCs.
    - At one point it'll start to lumber towards them, but it won't attack unless provoked.
  - The bodies impaled on the spikes are the bodies of some wizards.
    - The PCs can make out the bodies still have their belongings:
      - Wand sheaths and pouches bounce at their waists.
      - Necklaces and rings adorn the bodies and are clearly visible.
- Amongst the field, the PCs will see something unusual - a pile of corpses.
  - They can see from a distance that these corpses are clearly different to the rest of the battlefield
    - They are not wearing the livery of Breland or of Cyre.
    - Getting closer reveals that they are the corpses of Elves and Halflings.
      - They can also see the corpses of a few Fasteith.
  - This was two parties which came together and accidentally angered a Carcass Crab

## The Mouth of the Mine

> At the base of a low hill, a timbered opening leads into a dark tunnel.
> At first glance, it looks like any other abandoned mineshaft.
> Then, with a more careful inspection of the opening, you spot the House Cannith seal emblazoned on the center crossbeam.
