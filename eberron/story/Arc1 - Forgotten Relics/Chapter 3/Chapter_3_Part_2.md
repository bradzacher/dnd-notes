# Part 2 - Darguun

## Sea Travel

- The ship's name is The Dragon's Breath.
- It's captain is a half-elf named Eltarra d'Lyrandar.
- The House Lyrandar galleon leaves from the ports at the base of the Sharn cliffs.
  - It travels from the Hilt into the Straits of Shargon, staying close to the southern coast as it moves from Brelish to Zilargo waters and eventually turns north into Kraken Bay.
  - From there, the elemental-powered vessel enters the Ghaal River for the final leg of the journey to Rhukaan Draal.
- In addition to the adventurers, a dozen traders, travelers, and diplomats are aboard for the trip.
  - Many will disembark when the ship stops briefly in Korranberg, but a handful are scheduled to go all the way to the goblinoid nation's capital.
  - Cargo and trade goods, however, occupy the bulk of space aboard the vessel.
- On the third evening of the voyage, after the ship has entered Kraken Bay.
  - There is a heavy fog rolling through on this night.
  - 4 skeletons, 3 skeleton hobgoblins, and 1 minotaur skeleton will board the ship!
    - They climb aboard with grappling hooks in the dead of night.
  - PCs inside can make a DC15 Wisdom (Perception) check to hear scraping against the hull.
  - PCs on deck can make a DC15 Wisdom (Perception) check to spot the skeletons boarding.
  - On the 2nd round of combat - Eltarra will rally 4 of her crew to fight.
- Eltarra will reward the characters with 50gp each for their aid in defeating the skeletons.
  - She obviously has no idea what sent the skeletons, or why.
  - Their vessel has never before been attacked by anything on this route.

## Land Travel

- The Lightning Rail journey goes off without a hitch. It takes just 3 days to reach Sterngate.
  - The PCs will have to change lines in Starilaskur (this is included in their ticket).
- Sterngate itself is a large stone fortress that guards the pass into Darguun.
  - While it is served by a small village, it is clearly an active military installation.
  - Breland and Darguun are at peace, but there are still bugbear and goblin raiders that pour out of the mountains.
  - Sterngate is Breland's shield against them.
- The PCs can meet up with a caravan leaving from Sterngate within the next day.
  - It's boss - Brect - works for House Orien, but is not dragonmarked.
    - He commands a competent-looking and well-armed crew (including a contingent of House Deneith mercenaries).
    - He will assign the PCs to a wagon toward the rear of the caravan - carrying bolts of glamerweave.
  - If the PCs decide not to travel with the caravan, they will have a much rougher go of making it through to Rhukaan Draal.
    - The near-certainty of bugbear raiders should be impressed upon them.

> "Glad to have adventurers such as yourselves along for this trip," the caravan boss says, slapping one of you on the back.
> "The mountain clans have been acting up lately, and we could use your steel and muscle to make sure all of us make it to Rhukaan Draal in one piece.
> To show my appreciation, I'll give you twenty-five gold apiece when we safely make it to the goblin city."

- A small troop of Brelish soldiers, including two mounted on magebred brown bears, accompany the caravan for the first day and a half as part of their patrol before turning back to Sterngate.
- Beginning on the third day, PCs can make a Wisdom (Perception) check once per day at DC 20 to notice that the caravan is being shadowed.
- The caravan's more experienced members are aware that something is amiss and become nervous.
  - A DC 15 Wisdom (Insight) check will pick up on their discomfort.
- On the seventh day, the caravan will be attacked!
  - The ambushers are hiding and require a DC18 Wisdom (Perception) check to spot.
  - A dozen bugbears and over twice as many goblins attack the caravan.
  - The guards mobilise in its defence. The party will have to deal with 4 goblins, 1 bugbear and 1 bugbear chief.
  - On the second round of combat, the wagon behind the one which the PCs are assigned to will be shrouded in a fog cloud, providing concealment from goblin archers
  - On the third round of combat, a fireball explodes on the hillside farther up the caravan, taking out a large number of the attackers.

## [[Rhukaan Draal]] & The Bloody Market

> It is mid-morning when you finally arrive in Rhukaan Draal.
> Rhukaan Draal is, in many ways, a city of contrasts.
> It has only been inhabited by goblins for the past two decades, having been built around what was once a Cyran frontier town.
> Today it has grown into a sprawling goblinoid metropolis.
> The city appears as a crazy architectural tapestry; mud and timber huts surround ancient structures of stone and brick.
> These buildings are interspersed with a maze of canvas tents and pavilions, built up in every bit of available open space.
> Most of the roads are bare earth, and few of the wonders or conveniences of Sharn are evident here.
> Within this ramshackle city, a single building dominates the skyline — an enormous tower of red stone that rises up from the very center of the city.
> This is Khaar Mbar'ost, the court of the Lhesh Haruuc, the hobgoblin king.
> It is a ten-story structure of red granite built recently by House Cannith artisans to dominate the city's skyline... and it does this quite effectively.
>
> The bulk of the population are goblinoids.
> Timid goblins scurry out of your way while hobgoblins and the occasional band of bugbears swagger about, seeming to dare you to get in their way.
> A few humans the like are scattered throughout the streets – merchants and smugglers looking for goblin gold,
> or fugitives who have fled to Darguun to escape the justice of their homelands.

- The PC's journey to the city will end in the Warehouse district.
- Any of the party's travelling companions can direct them to the Bloody Market, and it's not hard to find.
  - The Bloody Market takes its name from the violent haggling that commonly occurs among the goblinoids, although guards defend merchants if blood is actually shed.
  - An ocean of tents and milling goblins fills the marketplace.
    - The goods are not of the highest quality, but almost anything can be found here, including poisons and other goods usually outlawed in more civilized nations.
- Most of the people in Rhukaan Draal, including the merchants, are unfriendly.
  - For each NPC, get the players to roll 1d6.
    - The players can roll a DC14 Wisdom (Insight) or a DC18 Charisma (Persuasion) check to instead roll 2d6.
    - On a 1 - the NPC directs the PCs to the Clenched Fist - a nearby bar that caters to non-goblins.
    - On a 6 - the NPC directs the PCs to meet with Old Went - a hobgoblin who knows practically all the humans in Rhukaan Draal.
    - On a 2, 3 or 4 - the NPC sends the PCs on a wild goose chase.

### Old Went

- Old Went can be found at The Sickly Chicken Inn.
- He is an older Hobgoblin, and is sitting at a table in a shadowy corner of the Inn.
- Years ago, Old Went served as a Deneith mercenary with the Cyrans.
  - He found that he had a knack for languages and getting along well with soldiers of other races.
  - He became the person soldiers would go to in order to send messages or seek out items and substances of dubious legality.
  - After leaving the army, he continued in his newfound career.
  - Now, he is a semi-retired fence who spends his days socializing among the expatriate smugglers and criminals of Rhukaan Draal.
  - He's well-liked in most local circles for his good nature and fair-dealings.
- Old Went knows Failin and will let the PCs know to look for him at the Clenched Fist with a DC 20 Charisma (persuasion) check.
  - He will make it obvious that he expects payment and the DC of the Persuasion check will be reduced by 2 for each 10 gp worth of a bribe he is given.
  - With a bribe of 100 gp or more, no check is needed.
  - If the PCs try to intimidate Old Went, he'll laugh and tell them to find Failin at the Clenched Fist.
    - However, word will quickly get around that the PCs are trouble, and any future dealings they have in Rhukaan Draal will become more far difficult.

### The Clenched Fist

> From the outside it looks uninviting, broken and ugly.
> Stacked stones and well-crafted wooden beams make up most of the building's outer structure.
> It's hard to see through the high windows, but the uncomfortable atmosphere from within can be felt outside.
>
> The placard above the door displays a mummified ogre's hand clenched tightly in a fist and nailed in place.
>
> As you enter the tavern through the heavy, metallic door, you're welcomed by watching eyes and a horrific scent.
> The bartender is rubbing a glass with a cloth, though it's not getting cleaner and makes no effort to acknowledge your presence.
>
> It's as dire inside as it is on the outside.
> Squared, wooden beams support the upper floor and the light fixtures attached to them.
> The walls are decorated, if you can call it that, with old paintings covered in dust.

- The Clenched Fist is in an old wooden building that has been haphazardly patched several times over.
- The barkeep is Darna, a friendly human woman who wears a wide variety of brightly colored silk scarves.
- The patrons all look various shades of seedy and dangerous - not the type of people you want to encounter in a dark alleyway.
- At one of the tables sits a man, facing the doorway and sipping deeply from a tankard of ale.
  - The PCs can ask around for anyone to point him out.

> A shock of unruly red hair with greying roots frames an weathered, bony face.
> Sunken in their sockets - a pair of dull aquamarine eyes, watch guardedly over the tavern, and eye you off as you approach.
> The man's weathered and lined skin contrasts with his clean, and well-tailored clothing.

- Failin waits for the adventurers to say what they want. He says little, but when he does speak he talks in rapid-fire bursts.
  - Failin is an old human - around 70 years old, though he is surprisingly sprightly.
  - Failing is a Excoriate - a dragonmarked heir that has been stripped of his name and association with the house.
    - One of the keen-eyed PCs will notice the back side of his left forearm is heavily scarred and badly mutilated.
    - Failin will dodge and brush off any question about the scars, saying that it's just the remnants of a job gone wrong.
- If the PCs explain that they want to get to Rose Quarry:

> Rose Quarry? Very far away. Near the border. Near the gray mist. Mining town.
> I can take you. Yes. But it will cost you. Sixty gold each, forty up front.
> You bring your own supplies.

- A DC 15 Charisma (Persuasion) check can reduce the price by one gp per person for each point the result is over 14.
  - If the PC is a member of House Orien and calls upon Failin's loyalties, the check has advantage, but in this case the price will be doubled if the check fails.

### Bugbear Brawl

> "Let's go, let's go," Failin says, leaping up from the table and gesturing toward the door. "Follow me, quickly! My land cart is hidden nearby."

- On their way to the land cart, Failin and the PCs are interrupted when three bugbears step out of the shadows and confront Failin.

> "Failin, you cheat us!" growls one of the bugbears as both of them raise their morningstars to threatening positions.

- Failin cheated them in their last deal - only delivering half of the goods.
  - The bugbears can be negotiated with, but tensions are high - they're all too willing to beat Failin to a pulp.
  - DC15 Charisma (Persuasion) check

### The Elemental-Powered Land Cart

> Failin leads you to a large stone outcropping in a secluded area not far from the Bloody Market.
> He rolls up his right sleeve to expose his scarred forearm and steps forward to touch the the stone.
> As he mutters a strange word, you watch as his forearm glows in a strange pattern.
> He steps back as the stone rumbles, and a strange covered wagon emerges from the rock wall.
> The four-wheeled vehicle has a canvas cover that encloses a large rear compartment, while an open bay at the front features a bench and foot well.
> The wagon appears to be made of wood, but an undulating pattern of constantly shifting rock, gem, and crystalline structures seem to overlay the wagon's wooden frame.
> "My land cart," Failin says in a quick burst. "Earth elemental powered. Get in. Time's short. Long road ahead."

- Any PC with experience with dragonmarks can make a DC15 Intelligence (History or Arcana) check to recognise the glyph of the Mark of Passage.
- Any PC that can speak draconic will recognise that he simply said the word "travel".
