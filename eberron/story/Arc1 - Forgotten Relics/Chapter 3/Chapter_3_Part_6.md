# Part 6 - Showdown

## Ambush

- Garrow and his Emerald Claw soldiers have followed the PCs to Whitehearth and wait to ambush them when they exit.
  - Garrow wants to conduct this encounter peacefully. His troops won't attack until he orders it.

> "Well done, adventurers," calls a voice you recognize as that of the creature from Rose Quarry.
> Figures appear from out of the shadows surrounding you:
>
> - six Emerald Claw soldiers armed with crossbows,
> - a gruff bearded man,
> - a female in a dark cloak,
> - four zombies.
>
> The vampire is nowhere to be seen, but you can hear his voice.
> "It is futile to fight us," the voice says.
> "Give me the third schema, and I will let you live.
> Oppose us, and I will take it from your corpses, and then raise your bodies to serve me."

- Garrow and the Order of the Emerald Claw have previously located the crescent-shaped schema.
  - Garrow wants the schema. He doesn't know about the creation pattern.
  - If the players are paying attention, they will have just learned that the schema they have found is the third schema, not the second!
- Garrow will use calm emotions on the party to attempt to make them more complicit if he thinks they're aggressive.
  - In combat - Garrow will stay back and let his minions do the fighting.
  - If the battle is going south, he will flee on horseback.
- The PCs have the following options:
  - Turn over the schema
    - Garrow will accept the schema and say:
      > A wise decision. You have the gratitude of Garrow and the Order.
    - Garrow mounts his horse - he, Keltis, and three cultists will ride off.
    - Garrow will call out (with thaumaturgy) as he leaves: "Kill Them!"

      - 3x Ghoul
      - 1x Ghast
      - 3x Emerald Claw Soldier

    - Garrow will stay back and just use cantrips.
      - He will also flee on horseback if it's looking grim.
    - Garrow will also accept their surrender mid-combat if the PCs decide to.
      - Follow the "turn over the schema" option, and combat continues with the now reduced force.

## Meeting with Lady Elaydren

> The land cart rolls its way through the familiar streets of Rhukaan Draal, as Failin pilots through the streets to his hiding place.
> As you disembark and Failin prepares his illusion, you see a small bugbear running around the corner.
> As he reaches you he doubles over, wheezing deeply.
> After a few seconds of him catching his breath, he says something in goblin.
> Failin turns to him and snaps a retort back goblin, and then says "In common, boy."
> The boy pokes his tongue out at Failin and then turns to you and takes a second as he is clearly trying to translate it in his head.
> Then in a thickly accent common he says proudly "The red lady at the gripped fist."
> You see Failin shake his head, as he says something back in goblin and clarifies for you "The red lady is at the _clenched_ fist."
> "It's clenched, not gripped boy."
> You see the boy sneer at Failin again and then stand there expectantly.

- Lady Elaydren will meet them in Rhukaan Draal at The Clenched Fist.
  - She will be in much better shape than last they met - though she will still not be in finery - she's wearing a simple traveller's cloak.
  - Her guard sits proudly with her - Orfon Ihise - a hardened veteran of the last war now turned mercenary.
  - The two still stick out amongst the patrons of The Clenched Fist.
- If the PCs triumphed:
  - If they give Elaydren the schema, she will pay them 200pp.
  - If they give Elaydren the pattern, she'll throw in an extra 100pp.
  - If they mention that Garrow talked of another schema, then read below
    > "Then it is true, the Emerald Claw has found one or more of the schemas."
- If the PCs failed:
  - If they give Elaydren the pattern, she'll pay them 100pp.
  - Lady Elaydren is disappointed in the loss of the schema.
    > "The Emerald Claw now has three of the schemas."

> "Time indeed grows short for us all.
> This is dire news - perhaps it is time to truly go on the offensive."
> She considers for a moment.
> "There's no time to waste, we must make haste back to Sharn - you can fill me in on all of the details on the way."
> "If you'll accompany me back to Sharn and ensure my safety, I'll see to it that you receive an additional 1,000gp when we arrive"
> She says with a smile.

- Lady Elaydren will pay for their trip, by sea, if they travel with her.
  - Captain of the ship = Bromwell d'Lyrandar
  - Other names:
    - Lyndon
    - GÃ¼nther
    - Bede
    - Ladislaus
  - The voyage goes by without issue.
