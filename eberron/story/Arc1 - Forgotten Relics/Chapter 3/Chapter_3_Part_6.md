# Part 6 - Showdown

- Garrow and his Emerald Claw soldiers have followed the PCs to Whitehearth and wait to ambush them when they exit.
  - Garrow wants to conduct this encounter peacefully. His troops won't attack until he orders it.

> "Well done, adventurers," calls a voice you recognize as that of the creature from Rose Quarry.
> Figures appear from out of the shadows surrounding you:
>
> - six Emerald Claw soldiers armed with crossbows,
> - a gruff bearded man,
> - a female in a dark cloak,
> - four zombies.
>
> The vampire is nowhere to be seen, but you can hear his voice.
> "It is futile to fight us," the voice says.
> "Give me the third schema, and I will let you live.
> Oppose us, and I will take it from your corpses, and then raise your bodies to serve me."

- Garrow and the Order of the Emerald Claw have previously located the crescent-shaped schema.
  - Garrow wants the schema. He doesn't know about the creation pattern.
  - If the players are paying attention, they will have just learned that the schema they have found is the third schema, not the second!
- Garrow will use calm emotions on the party to attempt to make them more complicit if he thinks they're aggressive.
  - In combat - Garrow will stay back and let his minions do the fighting.
  - If the battle is going south, he will flee on horseback.
- The PCs have the following options:
  - Turn over the schema
    - Garrow will accept the schema and say:
      > A wise decision. You have the gratitude of Garrow and the Order.
    - Garrow mounts his horse - he, Keltis, and three cultists will ride off.
    - Garrow will call out (with thaumaturgy) as he leaves: "Kill Them!"
  - Combat
    - Fighting the full force:
      - 1x Garrow
      - 1x Mallora
      - 1x Keltis
      - 4x Zombie
      - 6x Emerald Claw Soldier
    - If they hand over the schema first:
      - 3x Ghoul
      - 1x Ghast
      - 3x Emerald Claw Soldier
      - 1x Mallora
    - Garrow will stay back and just use cantrips.
      - He will also flee on horseback if it's looking grim.
    - Garrow will also accept their surrender mid-combat if the PCs decide to.
      - Follow the "turn over the schema" option, and combat continues with the now reduced force.
    - If the PCs lose (and fall unconscious), then Garrow will just leave them to die.
      - Roll death saves and stabilisation as required afterward and take it from there.

    - Garrow retreats

    - Garrow will just leave them to die, but will not slaughter them.
