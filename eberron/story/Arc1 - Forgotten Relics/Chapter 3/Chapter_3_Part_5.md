# Part 5 - Whitehearth

Whitehearth was carved out of the stone using powerful magic. Unless otherwise noted, assume the following conditions to be true:

- Walls are smooth gray stone, and ceilings are 8 feet high.
- Everbright lanterns once lit the workshops, but the mystical shock wave overloaded the lanterns
  - Now they only give off a dim radiance equivalent to shadowy illumination.
- Standard doors are made from three inches of steel and sealed with arcane lock.
  - These locks are tied to color-coded keycharms.
  - When the proper charm is pressed into a socket next to the door, the portal is unlocked.
- A permanent Mordenkainen's private sanctum spell protects the entire complex, making it hard to locate by magical means.
- Whitehearth is in a Fernia manifest zone that has been changed by the Mournland.
  - Flickering flames that give off more light than heat lick up the walls and across the ceiling sporadically, complementing the defective everbright lanterns.
  - These flames casting the majority of the facility (unless otherwise noted) in dim light.
  - As another effect of the manifest zone, materials that would normally burn are more likely to melt first, resulting in strange puddles of questionable origin throughout the facility.

## W1. Mineshaft

> The steep, sloping tunnel into the mine leads to a large, rough-hewn stone chamber.
> An opening in the far wall leads to four narrow, snaking tunnels.

- Four tunnels
  - Each tunnel has a hatch about 4-foot-wide and made of adamantine, set into the floor.
    - There is a simple locking mechanism on the hatch, and small socket just to the left of the mechanism - coated in blue enamel.
      - The socket fits the keycharm Lady Elaydren gave them.
    - Attempting to pick the lock will trigger the trap.
  - One of the tunnels leads to the correct shaft - three of the tunnels are decoys.
    - Opening a decoy hatch will trigger the trap.
    - **_TRAP: Shocking Grasp Trap_**
      - DC15 Dexterity saving throw
      - 5d8 lightning damage on failure, half as much on success.
  - Ways to discern the correct tunnel:
    - DC15 Intelligence (Investigation) or Wisdom (Survival) check will reveal the path of most traffic.
    - DC20 Intelligence (Investigation) check will reveal that the enamel seems worn on the correct hatch.
- When they open the correct hatch, read below.
  - The darkness is caused by the private sanctum spell - no light penetrates it.

> You open the hatch, revealing a circular metal shaft with a metal ladder running down the wall.
> The shaft descends around 15 feet before disappearing into complete darkness.

## W2. Rotator Room A

> Dim light, little more than that provided by a flickering candle, emanates from a crystalline globe embedded next to the entrance.
> This strange metal chamber is a perfect sphere, approximately 20 feet across.
> The surface of the sphere is grooved all over.
> The only exit from the room appears to be the shaft you descended.
> An octagonal metal plate is set into a pedestal at the center of the room.
> This metal plate is 1 foot across and contains nine sockets — five blue enamel sockets, two green sockets, and two brown sockets.

- When they insert the keycharm into a socket for the first time:

> A powerful vibration shakes the walls of the chamber, and slowly the entire room begins to rotate.
> You have to move to keep from falling down, but the grooved floor helps you stay on your feet.
> In less than a minute the chamber has rotated, and now the entryway appears as a doorway into a corridor instead of a hatch in the ceiling.

## W3. Laundry

> The corridor leads to a large room lined with four rows of floor-to-ceiling shelves.
> The shelves are stacked high with fresh bedsheets, blankets, towels and clothing.
> The pleasant smell of clean linen fills the air.
> At the far end of the room, a washbasin is set into the floor.

- If they choose to stay in the room for a bit:

> You watch as a white tunic floats out of the basin, neatly folds itself, and stacks itself on a nearby shelf.

## W4. Researcher's Wing

> As the sphere finishes rotating, you can immediately smell burnt wood.
> Inside the corridor is dark, but at the end of the hallway there is a flickering glow.
> You can see a layer of soot and ash coating the walls and ceiling of the corridor.

- DC14 Wisdom (Perception):
  > You can hear faint the sound of crackling flames coming from the same place as the glow.
- DC16 Wisdom (Perception):
  > Mixed amongst the soot and ash, you can pick out some charred and dirty remains.
- If the PCs choose not to sneak, they will be attacked by two living flaming spheres in the corridor.
  > The glow at the end of the hallway grows brighter as the sound of crackling flames gets louder.
  > Two spheres of white-hot fire roll out of the doorway.
  > Despite the lack of features, they appear to have noticed and be reacting to you.

### W5. Burnt-out Barracks

> The door to this room has been melted into slag.
> Inside - hints of tables, beds, bookshelves, and bodies are visible amongst the ash and ruin of this room.

- There is nothing left in-tact in this room.

### W6. Bath

> A 10 by 10-foot pool of clear liquid occupies most of the first chamber.
> A row of marble latrines is set against the walls of the far chamber.
> You notice a partially charred corpse in the far chamber.

- The corpse looks fresh - like it could have just died (as with any corpse)
  - The burns still give off some heat.
  - The corpse has 5sp, 3gp and the **brown keycharm**.
    - One one of the fingers is a signet ring bearing the House Cannith seal.
      - If the ring is removed, the seal fades away.

### W7. Emergency Stores

- The door is locked: DC15 Lockpicking check.
  - Not locked by a keycharm.
- The store contains:
  - Dried and preserved food
  - Skins full of water
  - Skins full of wine
  - A variety of mundane supplies (like clothing, bed rolls and rope)
  - 1x potion of healing
  - 1x potion of greater healing
  - 1x potion of vitality
  - 1x potion of fire resistance

### W8. Support Wing

> A corridor of plain gray stone extends ahead of you.
> In the flickering light from the dim everbright lanterns embedded in the walls, you see a few trails of crusted blood running along the floor, as if someone was dragged down the corridor.
> At the far end of the hall you see three portals:
>
> - an open archway to the left,
> - a door propped open straight ahead,
> - and a sealed metal door to the right.

- The sealed door is locked with a brown keycharm.

  - She admits to eating the former inhabitants of the base, but points out that they were already dead.
    - And besides, they grow back.
- Rorsa wants to hear about the outside world.
  - In exchange, she tells the party about the living flaming sphere in the northeast (W5) and the stone wolf in the southwest (W16).
  - Rorsa has always wanted to find a way to free the rest of the wolves from area W16, but she is frightened of the bizarre creature that guards them.
    - Rorsa asks the adventurers to destroy the stone wolf, and in exchange she promises to give them a **green keycharm** and her **pearl of power**.
