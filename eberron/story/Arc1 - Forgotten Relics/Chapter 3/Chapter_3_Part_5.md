# Part 5 - Whitehearth

Whitehearth was carved out of the stone using powerful magic. Unless otherwise noted, assume the following conditions to be true:

- Walls are smooth gray stone, and ceilings are 8 feet high.
- Everbright lanterns once lit the workshops, but the mystical shock wave overloaded the lanterns
  - Now they only give off a dim radiance equivalent to shadowy illumination.
- Standard doors are made from three inches of steel and sealed with arcane lock.
  - These locks are tied to color-coded keycharms.
  - When the proper charm is pressed into a socket next to the door, the portal is unlocked.
- A permanent Mordenkainen's private sanctum spell protects the entire complex, making it hard to locate by magical means.
- Whitehearth is in a Fernia manifest zone that has been changed by the Mournland.
  - Flickering flames that give off more light than heat lick up the walls and across the ceiling sporadically, complementing the defective everbright lanterns.
  - These flames casting the majority of the facility (unless otherwise noted) in dim light.
  - As another effect of the manifest zone, materials that would normally burn are more likely to melt first, resulting in strange puddles of questionable origin throughout the facility.

## W1. Mineshaft

> The steep, sloping tunnel into the mine leads to a large, rough-hewn stone chamber.
> An opening in the far wall leads to four narrow, snaking tunnels.

- Four tunnels
  - Each tunnel has a hatch about 4-foot-wide and made of adamantine, set into the floor.
    - There is a simple locking mechanism on the hatch, and small socket just to the left of the mechanism - coated in blue enamel.
      - The socket fits the keycharm Lady Elaydren gave them.
    - Attempting to pick the lock will trigger the trap.
  - One of the tunnels leads to the correct shaft - three of the tunnels are decoys.
    - Opening a decoy hatch will trigger the trap.
    - **_TRAP: Shocking Grasp Trap_**
      - DC15 Dexterity saving throw
      - 5d8 lightning damage on failure, half as much on success.
  - Ways to discern the correct tunnel:
    - DC15 Intelligence (Investigation) or Wisdom (Survival) check will reveal the path of most traffic.
    - DC20 Intelligence (Investigation) check will reveal that the enamel seems worn on the correct hatch.
- When they open the correct hatch, read below.
  - The darkness is caused by the private sanctum spell - no light penetrates it.

> You open the hatch, revealing a circular metal shaft with a metal ladder running down the wall.
> The shaft descends around 15 feet before disappearing into complete darkness.

## W2. Rotator Room A

> Dim light, little more than that provided by a flickering candle, emanates from a crystalline globe embedded next to the entrance.
> This strange metal chamber is a perfect sphere, approximately 20 feet across.
> The surface of the sphere is grooved all over.
> The only exit from the room appears to be the shaft you descended.
> An octagonal metal plate is set into a pedestal at the center of the room.
> This metal plate is 1 foot across and contains nine sockets — five blue enamel sockets, two green sockets, and two brown sockets.

- When they insert the keycharm into a socket for the first time:

> A powerful vibration shakes the walls of the chamber, and slowly the entire room begins to rotate.
> You have to move to keep from falling down, but the grooved floor helps you stay on your feet.
> In less than a minute the chamber has rotated, and now the entryway appears as a doorway into a corridor instead of a hatch in the ceiling.

## W3. Laundry

> The corridor leads to a large room lined with four rows of floor-to-ceiling shelves.
> The shelves are stacked high with fresh bedsheets, blankets, towels and clothing.
> The pleasant smell of clean linen fills the air.
> At the far end of the room, a washbasin is set into the floor.

- If they choose to stay in the room for a bit:

> You watch as a white tunic floats out of the basin, neatly folds itself, and stacks itself on a nearby shelf.

- Treasure:
  - 1x Duster

## W4. Researcher's Wing

> As the sphere finishes rotating, you can immediately smell burnt wood.
> Inside the corridor is dark, but at the end of the hallway there is a flickering glow.
> You can see a layer of soot and ash coating the walls and ceiling of the corridor.

- DC14 Wisdom (Perception):
  > You can hear faint the sound of crackling flames coming from the same place as the glow.
- DC16 Wisdom (Perception):
  > Mixed amongst the soot and ash, you can pick out some charred and dirty remains.
- If the PCs choose not to sneak, they will be attacked by two living flaming spheres in the corridor.
  > The glow at the end of the hallway grows brighter as the sound of crackling flames gets louder.
  > Two spheres of white-hot fire roll out of the doorway.
  > Despite the lack of features, they appear to have noticed and be reacting to you.

### W5. Burnt-out Barracks

> The door to this room has been melted into slag.
> Inside - hints of tables, beds, bookshelves, and bodies are visible amongst the ash and ruin of this room.

- There is almost nothing left in-tact in this room.
- Treasure (DC12 Intelligence (Investigation) check):
  - 1x Sungglebeast (Owlbear)

### W6. Bath

> A 10 by 10-foot pool of clear liquid occupies most of the first chamber.
> A row of marble latrines is set against the walls of the far chamber.
> You notice a partially charred corpse in the far chamber.

- The corpse looks fresh - like it could have just died (as with any corpse)
  - The burns still give off some heat.
  - The corpse has 5sp, 3gp and the **brown keycharm**.
    - One one of the fingers is a signet ring bearing the House Cannith seal.
      - If the ring is removed, the seal fades away.

## W7. Emergency Stores

- The door is locked: DC15 Lockpicking check.
  - Not locked by a keycharm.

  - Dried and preserved food
  - Skins full of water

  - A variety of mundane supplies (like clothing, bed rolls and rope)
  - 1x potion of healing
  - 1x potion of greater healing
  - 1x potion of vitality
  - 1x potion of fire resistance

## W8. Support Wing

> A corridor of plain gray stone extends ahead of you.
> In the flickering light from the dim everbright lanterns embedded in the walls, you see a few trails of crusted blood running along the floor, as if someone was dragged down the corridor.
> At the far end of the hall you see three portals:
>
> - an open archway to the left,
> - a door propped open straight ahead,
> - and a sealed metal door to the right.

- The sealed door is locked with a brown keycharm.

### Rorsa

  - All the humans who had cared for her and her kind were dead.
  - She managed to figure out how to open the doors and operate the rotator rooms, and she and her friends moved to this wing.
  - She admits to eating the former inhabitants of the base, but points out that they were already dead.
    - And besides, they grow back.
- Rorsa wants to hear about the outside world.
  - In exchange, she tells the party about the living flaming sphere in the northeast (W5) and the stone wolf in the southwest (W16).
  - Rorsa has always wanted to find a way to free the rest of the wolves from area W16, but she is frightened of the bizarre creature that guards them.
    - Rorsa asks the adventurers to destroy the stone wolf, and in exchange she promises to give them a **green keycharm** and her **pearl of power**.

> The room is filled with shelves lined with scrolls and leather-bound books.
> Two sturdy oak desks are set against one wall.
> Slumped over one of the desks is the corpse of a female.

- Most of the items in the room are business ledgers - orders for food, receipts for bulk spell components, and the like.

### W13.1. The Kitchen

> The kitchen is large, and you pickup the faint smell of stale wine as you enter.
> To one side sits a well - filled to the brin with pure water.

- If the party wants to enter W17 before W16, the wolf will react to them.

### W16. Kennel

> Steel cages line the walls of the large room.
> In the dim light you can just make out the shapes of animals inside some of the cages.
> A creature with the shape of a wolf stands guard.
> Plates of black marble have been fused to its flesh.
> In addition to the stone armor that shields its flanks, its muzzle has been replaced by an elongated maw filled with row upon row of obsidian teeth.

### W17. Empty Room

  - If the orange keycharm is used before the red keycharm, it activates the trap.
  - The everbright lantern goes out and the sphere is plunged into darkness.
  - The chamber starts to rotate weirdly and randomly until the opening eventually faces down.
    - PCs must make a DC10 Dexterity (Acrobatics) check to maintain their balance and avoid falling down into the hole.
    - Those that fail fall 30ft (3d6) damage into the water below.
      - The water is 20ft deep.

## W19. Room of Broken Light

> As the door to the room slides open, you're greeted with an almost blindingly bright light.
> All surfaces in this room - the walls, ceiling and floor are mirrored and reflective.
> To one side of the room you see a mass of brilliant, swirling colour.
> It's a beautiful rainbow that's so bright it hurts to look at for too long.
> You can watch as the ball bounces slowly off of the mirrors.
> Squinting through the light, you can make out a doorway at the far side of the room.

- As they take a step in:
  - All characters are deafened whilst in the room
    > The dull drone of the facility is replaced by complete silence as you cross the threshold to the room.
- The light is actually a Greater Living Colour Spray, and will attempt to destroy anything that enters the room.

### W20. Scrying Room

> As you open the doorway, a large chamber stretches away from the doorway, and intense heat shimmers in the air.
> A raging bonfire burns about 40 feet away, near the far wall, casting dancing shadows across the room.
> A second one burns about 60 feet away, along the southern wall.
> In the center of the room, a large crucible filled with bubbling molten glass glows white hot.
> Long, snaking heads made of iron and brass rise up from the molten pool like some metal hydra.
>
> You instinctively recoil at the sight of the inferno in front of you.
> But after a few seconds you realise the blazing fires give off no heat at all.
> Nor is there any smell of smoke or burning chemicals.
> The crackling and rumbling roar you'd expect to hear is silent.
>
> Above you, the roof has been replaced with a dark metal dome.

- A DC14 Wisdom (Perception) check will reveal the chest:
  > Just south of the crucible and the construct, a crystalline chest reflects the hot light.
  > Through the translucent material, you can see that the chest contains a variety of objects, including what looks like a diamond-shaped slab of metal.
- A DC15 Wisdom (Perception) check will reveal the dome should open:
  > Looking at the dome in the ceiling, you can see a seam running through its center.

- A DC20 Wisdom (Perception) check will reveal the dome controls tucked away in an alcove by the door.
- Treasure:
  - **red keycharm**
  - 2x potion of fire resistance.

## W21. Entryway to the Machine Chamber

> At the end of the corridor stands two dark metal doors.
> You can see a faint shimmer around their edges.
> As you approach you can feel waves of heat rolling out through the cracks.

### W22. Machine Chamber

> This large chamber stretches away from the doorway, and intense heat shimmers in the air.
> A raging bonfire burns about 40 feet away, near the far wall, casting dancing shadows across the room.
> A second one burns about 60 feet away, along the southern wall.
> In the center of the room, a large crucible filled with bubbling molten glass radiates terrible heat.
> Long, snaking heads made of iron and brass rise up from the molten pool like some metal hydra.
> Just south of the crucible and the construct, a crystalline chest reflects the hot light.
> Through the translucent material, you can see that the chest contains a variety of objects, including what can only be the diamond-shaped schema that you seek.
> Then, with an angry crackle of flame and a threatening hiss of steam, the bonfires begin to move toward you.

- There are two Fire Elementals in this room which will attack as soon as they see the PCs
- The heat in the room is extreme (>110 degrees F)
  - Creatures who begin their turn within 5 feet of the crucible filled with molten glass must make a DC 12 Constitution saving throw or take 3 (1d6) fire damage.
- The dome controls require a DC20 Intelligence (Arcana or Investigation) check to understand (one action), and an action to use.
  - A PC can also try and just use the controls without understanding them with a Wisdom check at disadvantage:
    - 25 or more:
      - The dome opens
    - 20 – 24:
      - The PC gains some understanding, knows that these controls can open the dome.
      - They can make a check (either another Wisdom check or an Intelligence check as above) with advantage next round.
    - 16 – 19:
      - The dome does not open, but the PC knows that these controls can open the dome.
    - 13 – 15:
      - The dome does not open, the scrying illusion in W20 is dispelled
    - 9 – 12:
      - The dome does not open, and it jams. The next attempt to open it has disadvantage.
    - 8 or less:
      - The dome does not open and the crucible is shaken, spilling molten glass.
      - Creatures within 10 feet of the crucible must make a DC 14 Dexterity saving throw, taking 27 (5d10) fire damage on a failed save or half as much on a successful one.
