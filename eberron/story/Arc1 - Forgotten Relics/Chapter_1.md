# Chapter 1

## The Job

> An orange glow covers the top of Lyrandar Tower as the sun sinks in the sky. Above, the great airships of House Lyrandar float like leviathans surrounded by brilliant rings of elemental energy. Below, bridges crisscross at all levels of the city, connecting Sharn's great towers. The sounds of crying children, barking vendors, cursing skycoach drivers, and braying hippogriffs rise up to become a unique din that can only be heard in the City of Towers.
>
> Each of you carries a letter from your acquaintance Sergeant Germaine Vilroy of the Sharn Watch that reads, "I’m calling on you for a job. I can’t write the details, but it pays well and requires your skills. Meet me at the airship dock on top of Lyrandar Tower. Come armed."

(after players introduce themselves)

> As darkness descends on the city, you see windows light up the towers around you from bottom to top. A cool wind whisks between you, drowning out the other noises of the city. A nearby lift rises, carrying a human in her mid-thirties with close cropped black hair and a glowing pipe in her mouth. Germaine gives a wry smile as she nods to you all, saying, "Thanks for coming."

- Party meets [[Germaine Vilroy]], a Sergeant of the [[Sharn Watch]].
  - She sent each of the PCs a letter.
- Vilroy has a job for the party:
  - Germaine has an appointment to meet with a warforged named [[Coal]], who claims to have knowledge of a crime being committed in [[Old Sharn]]. Germaine wants the party to meet with Coal first and see if what she says adds up. Germaine is worried that, with her status as a Watch sergeant, her presence will call undue attention and endanger Coal.
  - Germaine can give the characters 25 gp each now and another 50 gp each if they bring in Coal.
  - If the characters consent to meet with Coal, Germaine provides the location of the Cog Carnival, a bar in High Walls frequented by warforged, and the appointed meeting time.
  - Germaine also provides a Sharn Watch writ of enforcement. The writ authorizes the bearers to conduct official duties of the Watch under Sergeant Vilroy's authority. City workers and other members of the Watch respect the writ, sometimes grudgingly, as long as the characters don’t engage in flagrantly illegal activity.

### Secrets

- Germaine is on the payroll of the [[Boromar Clan]] - this is why she doesn't want to investigate herself.
- Germaine is concerned for Coal, because she's afraid that Coal is caught in between two criminal clans.

## Getting to High Walls

- On foot the journey from upper Central to lower Tavick's Landing will take about 2.5h.
  - Can take a coach for 2sp and half the time.
  - Can take a sky taxi for 2gp and just 15 minutes.
- Roll on the tables for some colour to fill out the journey

## High Walls and the Cog Carnival

> The stench of body odor, garbage, and tobacco mix together in the streets. High walls cut this district’s crumbling, vandalized buildings off from the rest of Sharn, though towers rise over the walls like imposing sentries. Many people stand idly on street corners, eying you suspiciously and keeping to themselves.

- Some of the PCs are from sharn and lower Tavick's Landing so finding the Cog Carnival is pretty straight-forward. If they want to ask, they can talk to any of the residents to get directions.
- Roll again on the lower sharn table for colour as they make their way there.
- The Cog Carnival is hard to miss - it has an illusory "neon" sign above the door, and a hulking warforged bouncer at the door.
  - The front wall of the cog carnival has graffiti sprayed on it - anti-Warforged slogans
    - "Forged Are Scrap!"
    - "Metalheads Go Home!"

## Entering the Cog Carnival

- The Cog Carnival is a "safe space" for Warforged. The proprietor [[Smelt]] is a Warforged, and she created and maintains this space for Warforged to gather and socialise without worrying about people outside.
- Warforged can enter for free, but all other races must pay a 5cp entrance fee.
  - If the characters wave their writs, make a good argument and pass a DC15 Charisma (Persuasion) check, the bouncer will begrudgingly let them enter for 2cp.

> Smoky, low flames in a fireplace barely illuminate the cracked stone walls and filthy floor of this establishment. The single-room space is crowded with warforged with severed digits or limbs, scars, burns, and other wounds. Other warforged in the area are gathered around traditional dice, card, dart, and board games as well as carnival competitions such as throwing metal rings onto posts, tossing a ball at a tower of weighted iron cups hard enough to make them fall down, and striking a homemade machine hard enough with a hammer to make it ring a bell.
>
> A small bar in the corner serves cheap ale. Behind this bar, a warforged bartender shouts jeers at patrons losing games.

## Finding Coal

- PCs can either:
  - Ask other patrons to find Coal. DC13 Charisma (Persuasion) check to convince a patron to point Coal out.
  - Bribe other patrons to find Coal. A patron will ask for 1gp to point Coal out.
  - Look around for coal. DC15 Wisdom (Perception) check to spot Coal. It's dimly lit, so a character without Darkvision will make this check at disadvantage.

### Talking to Coal

- Coal will be on edge the entire conversation, especially if the PCs approach all at once.
- If the PCs show their writs and explain that Vilroy sent them, Coal will calm down a bit, but she be vigilant and fidgety the entire time

Coal will tell the characters the following:

- Her friend Razor (also a Warforged) had been working a job for a month or so.
  - The job was to go into lower Sharn at night with a number of other Warforged to excavate the ruins down there.
  - Razor was hired by [[Alden d'Lyrandar]] for the job - it was a "secret mission".
  - Coal also started working in the last few weeks.
    - Getting work as a foreign Warforged is hard.
  - Coal witnessed the bosses of the excavation murder Razor.
    - She thinks it was to make an example of her

As the PCs ask questions, pick a good time to interrupt them.

- A bolt of fire narrowly misses the PCs and Coal, and impacts on the wall directly behind her head.
  - Coal **immediately** bolts out the back door.
  - PCs can turn and see a humanoid fleeing out the front door.
  - PCs have a choice - front or back - either way they will be 60ft behind their target.

### Secrets

- Any Sharn natives know about some of the racism and animosity towards Warforged.
  - Some people have negative feelings due to the association between the last war and the Warforged.
  - Many people lost friends and family in the war, and some were likely killed my warforged fighting for another nation.
  - [[Nolan Toranak]] is a dwarf and the councilor for the Cogs. Members of his family were killed by warforged during the Last War, and Toranak harbors a bitter grudge against House Cannith and the warforged. He has tried to have warforged reclassified as property, and seeks to suppress warforged activists in the Cogs.

## The Chase

- PCs are 60ft behind their target.
- Give the PCs a few rounds of chasing to allow them to creatively attempt to catch up.
- Roll on the urban complication table and present a scenario: https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dmg/running-the-game#UrbanChaseComplications
- Once the scenario is complete, the characters hear the warforged scream for help in a nearby alley.
  - Coal is on the ground, surrounded by 5 humanoids. Use the following stat blocks:
    - 1x Shifter
    - 3x Kobold
    - 1x Acolyte
  - The PCs are around 60ft away - roll initiative.
    - Initially the "bandits" don't notice the PCs, and will move to attack Coal.
    - Each bandit will flee when they reach half HP.
  - If the PCs capture any of the bandits, a successful DC 13 Charisma (Intimidation) check compels the captive to reveal the secrets below.
    - They don't know anything else - this was supposed to be their way into the organisation.
    - They will be scared for their lives, and will beg to be spared.

### Secrets

- The group works for [[Daask]], a criminal organization.
- The criminals were told to kill Coal via a letter sent by a Daask lieutenant named [[Garra]]. The letter has since been destroyed.
- Daask's members are mostly immigrants from Droaam and some of the local population from the Cogs and lower wards of [[Sharn]].

## Talking with Coal - Part 2

- Now that the PCs have saved Coal, she'll trust them, and open up more.
- She'll still be frazzled by the events, but she'll open up:
  - Razor served with Coal in the Cyran military during the Last War, during which Coal lost her right arm.
  - Razor and Coal had trouble finding work in Sharn, due to the fact that many businesses are reluctant to hire warforged foreigners. The pair became desperate for money.
  - A month ago, Razor told Coal she had a job working on a long-term secret mission for Alden d'Orien, the scion of a dragonmarked house. Warforged from other parts of the city were also recruited to help in the task. The job required physical labor, so Coal’s injury prevented her from being able to do the job. Razor planned to save money then buy Coal a new arm so she could work with her.
  - Razor would often come back from work sullen or wounded but never opened up about the job until shortly before she died. Razor confessed that the job was more dangerous than it seemed when she was recruited. Razor was planning to quit before she died.

There are now a few directions the PCs can go:

- They can go talk to Vilroy and report what they know.
- They can go talk to Alden d'Lyrandar and question him.
- They can go investigate the elevator.

### Secrets

- If pushed, Coal can share details about the job; the location of the elevator, and the time.

## The Elevator

- The elevator is located in lower Dura.
- The characters can easily stake it out and eventually watch a group of warforged leaving the elevator carrying tools.
- At any point during the day they can investigate the elevator.
  - DC15 Intelligence (Investigation) check will reveal that the lift panel can be removed with tinker's tools, thieves' tools or similar.
  - Behind the panel lies a small Eberron dragonshard attached to the panel via wires.
  - A DC13 Intelligence (Investigation or Arcana) check will reveal a loose wire and the socket to which it attaches.
    - Reconnecting this wire will cause the old doors to screech shut, and the lift to descend.

### Secrets

- Any character proficient in Arcana knows that dragonshards are what power all arcane contraptions.
  - They store magical energy and are amazing at holding enchantments.
