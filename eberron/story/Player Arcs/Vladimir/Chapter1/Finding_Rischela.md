# Finding Rischela

## Meeting Uncle

- Receive a message from [[Vladimir van d'Orien]]'s uncle - [[Yakov d'Orien]]

  - Asks Vlad to come see him at once, at the Unicorn estate:
    > Vladimir, I have a task that requires your attention.
    > Please meet me at the Unicorn Estate.
    >
    > Come at once if convenient.
    > If inconvenient, come all the same.

- The Unicorn Estate
  - The estate is magically enchanted with illusion and abjuration magic:
    - Scrying has no affect on creatures inside the estate.
    - Enchantment spells of 3rd level or lower cannot affect creatures inside the estate, unless they wish it.
    - The weather on the estate is always pleasant and sunny, regardless of the weather outside.
    - When a creature enters the estate for the first time, an illusion of a unicorn appears nearby the creature and brays loudly, announcing its presence.
  - Two guards stand to attention at the front.

> Many of the grand homes in Mithral Tower are true to the district’s name, boasting mithral filigree.
> The Sharn Watch seems to be everywhere in this neighborhood full of busy scions climbing into skycoaches, hosting opulent parties, and showing off their latest purchases at all hours of the day.
>
> Unicorn Estate has a grand unicorn statue and unicorn-shaped topiaries adorning the yard beyond an open, wrought-iron gate.
> Flanking this gate are two guards in House Orien livery.
> Each wears a beautiful helm shaped like the head of a unicorn.
>
> The magnificent marble home is clearly owned by one of the city’s wealthiest dragonmarked families.
> Seated on a patio couch is a single man smoking an ornate pipe.
> Two more guards dressed like the ones at the gates stand nearby.

- Yakov greets Vlad warmly and asks about his companions
- Things Yakov knows:
  - Vlad has been helping the city watch
    - He's read the report about the incident with Coal.
    - If they ask why - because of course he'd hear about a report mentioning a prominent member of House Lyrandar.
  - He has heard murmuring of Vlad's travel to [[Darguun]]
    - Though he doesn't know any details about why.
- The quest:
  - [[Rischela d'Orien]] has been missing for a few weeks, which is unlike her.
  - This is a sensitive quest given her position in the house.
    - Yakov stresses this point.
  - Yakov wants Vlad to see to it personally, given his recent reputation.
  - Rischela's workshop can be found in Upper Tavick's Landing - in the Ocean View district.
    - Yakov has a key to the building.

## Rischela's Residence

> The Ocean View district is on the southern-most edge of the city.
> The streets are immaculate and lined with terrace housing - with the inner row standing taller than the outer.
> Occasionally there is a break in the outer row of houses, which reveals a landing stretching out and giving a full view of the endless seas beyond.
> The smell of sea air fills your lungs, and you can just make out the sound of the sea breaking on the cliffs below.
>
> You eventually arrive at Rischela's house.
> The apartment looks fairly unassuming from the outside.
> Above the door is the familiar unicorn head symbol, subtly engraved as to be barely noticeable.

- If they chose to wander out on the landing, they'll be able to look back on the houses:
  > Looking back at the rows of houses you see they seamlessly blend together - it's impossible to tell where one starts and one ends.
  > From the looks of it, each of the houses has 3 stories - one ground, one above, and one below.
  > Some of the houses have a balcony jutting out of the facade, and you can see some of the residents eating a meal in the sun.
- Characters with passive perception 15 will notice a faint but strange smell, barely detectable above the salty smell of the sea.
  - DC15 Intelligence check to recognise the smell as Ozone.

> Inside the home is a bit of a mess. Bookshelves line most of the walls and are overflowing with books, with some of the shelves bowing from the weight.
> Looking past the mess - the home is beautifully appointed.
> The sitting room has luxurious lounges and beautifully crafted furniture surrounding a large fireplace.
> A thick and shaggy rug adorns the floor in the Orien colours - it feels wonderfully soft beneath your shoes.

- Kitchen

> The kitchen is well appointed, if a little small.
> There are numerous utensils, knives, pots and pans hanging around - all of which look like they're barely touched.

- Upstairs
  - The double doors lead out onto the balcony.

> The bedroom upstairs is opulent to say the least. There's a massive 4-post bed that looks undisturbed.
> A similar rug sticks out from beneath the bed.
> In the corner you see a wardrobe, and beside it an ornate vanity.
> On the other side is a pair of double doors.

- The stairs leading down are hidden underneath the rug downstairs.
  - DC12 Intelligence (Investigation) check to find it in about 5 minutes.
    - Passive investigation can find it after 20 minutes if they fail the active check.
  - When the hatch is opened, the smell from outside is much, much stronger.

> You open the hatch, and the strong smell washes over you in a wave of warm air.
> You see a set of stairs leading down, with a small landing and a plain door at the bottom.
> You can barely make out a soft crackling noise coming from down the stairs.

- The basement workshop.

> You open the door and the first thing you can see is the 3 creatures of living lightning darting around the room.
> They notice the open door and dart towards you in an instant.
> See a flash of shimmering light and a set of runes on the ground glow as they collide with a barrier.
> The creatures let out a distorted roar as they bounce around their container, trying desperately to find a way out.
>
> There is a circle of runes drawn onto the ground, creating a 20ft radius circle.
> At the center of the barrier, you see another, smaller circle - about 5ft diameter.
>
> Taking a moment to look around the room, it looks to be a workshop of some kind.
> There are numerous desks covered in parchments, tools and crystals.
> To one side of the room is a small, dingy cot.

- There is a spell that is containing the elementals (for now).
  - With the characters there, the elementals want out, and will start pushing the containment to its limits.
  - They have a bit of time before the spell fails.
  - Make sure to make it feel like a pressing problem
    - Describe the sounds and flashes.
    - Describe how the sound and light of the barrier gets softer with each hit.
  - They can dispel the barrier early or let it fall.
