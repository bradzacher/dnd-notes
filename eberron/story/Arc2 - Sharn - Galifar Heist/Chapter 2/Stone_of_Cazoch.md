# Stone of Cazoch

- The Stone of Cazoch is an artifact that once belonged to the Abolethic Sovereignty.
- For millennia it was held in a vault within the ancient floating city of `Xxiphu` on the world of `Abeir`, but it was lost during the Wailing Years.
- According to some histories, it was brought to `Abeir-Toril` when `Xxiphu` first plummeted to the world and settled deep below what is now the Sea of Fallen Stars.
- According to others, an aboleth who came to `Abeir-Toril` before the arrival of `Xxiphu` created the Stone; or perhaps he fled to `Abeir-Toril` carrying the stone and `Xxiphu` came in pursuit of their prize.
- Some versions of the tale claim that the Stone was forged during the primeval battles between `Shar` and `Selûne`, in the very moment that the world of `Toril` was formed.
- Whether the Stone predates or co-dates the creation of `Toril`, in arcane terms this gives the Stone a position of primacy, making it capable of effects which no magic item or artifact created in these younger days could possibly duplicate.

## The Ritual

- When the proper ritual is performed, the Stone magically eliminates a memory or piece of knowledge from everyone on `Toril` except for the person who is attuned to the Stone.
- The use of the Stone to erase memory is a special ritual-form of legend lore which takes 12 hours to cast.
  - Performing the ritual requires:
    - The ability to cast legend lore.
    - Knowledge of the ritual modifications to the spell.
    - The use of a second abolethic artifact, a small tetrahedron of red jade. (This artifact is still in Lord Cathan's possession.)
    - Special incenses suffused with the blood of an aboleth (2,500gp cost) and four ivory strips worth at least 50gp each.
  - During the ritual, the burning of the incense causes the four sides of the tetrahedron to unfold, revealing slots into which the ivory strips are then inserted.
  - The Stone is then placed within the tetrahedron and the sides closed around it.
  - As the ritual completes, the tetrahedron opens once more, revealing the Stone of Cazoch as it releases a burst of psionic energy.
  - This energy attempts to refract through the person attuned to the Stone, forcing them to make a Wisdom saving throw with a difficulty commensurate to the scope of the memory or knowledge they are seeking to eliminate.
    - (The memory of something with little significance and known to very few people would have a smaller DC than something of great significance or known to a large number of people.)
- A group of people can attempt to perform the ritual together in order to reduce the difficulty of this saving throw by -2 per additional person
  - (by spreading psionic refraction between them).
- The number of characters participating in the ritual is limited by the level of the character leading the ritual (i.e., a 5th level character could lead a ritual with up to 5 people), and all participants must succeed at the saving throw in order for the ritual to be successful.
  - On a failure, the ritual member fails to refract the psionic energy and the memory they were seeking to erase is eliminated only from their mind.
    - If a particularly significant piece of knowledge was being targeted, the failure might also invoke a general fugue state for minutes, hours, or days (at the DM's discretion).
  - On a success, the knowledge is eliminated: Wiped clean from scrolls and inscriptions. Removed from all living memory except for those attuned to the Stone or participating in the ritual.
- Note, however, that:
  - This is very specific. For example, Cathan only eliminated the knowledge of the Vault's location, which is why other lore regarding the Vault (like its existence and the keys required to open it) can still be found.
    - As if reality had become a poorly expurgated book, you can still see where the 'text' has been snipped out if you know where to look.
  - This only destroys current knowledge, not the subject of the knowledge nor the ability to learn that knowledge in the future.
    - Making everyone forget Bob, for example, doesn't stop Bob from saying, 'Hi! I'm Bob!'
- **USING THE STONE:** Communicating with the Stone, receiving knowledge from the Stone, or performing the knowledge-erasing ritual requires the user to be attuned to the Stone. This can be a somewhat unpleasant process as the attunement takes the form of your thoughts slowly becoming compatible with the utterly alien, abolethic thought-forms of the Stone.

## The Stone Blinded

- As Dragon Heist begins, the Stone of Cazoch has been blinded by Lord [[Cathan ir'Demell]]; he has removed its three Eyes.
- This is not a physically difficult procedure:
  - If someone is attuned to the Stone, an Eye can simply be physically popped out (or popped in).
  - With the Eyes missing, however, the capabilities of the Stone are limited.
- A simple physical examination of the Stone will make it clear that the three Eyes are missing.

### Abilities

- BLINDED: The Stone is inert.
- 1 EYE RESTORED: With one Eye restored, the Stone can communicate, but still not see the secrets it once contained.
- 2 EYES RESTORED: Although still crippled, the Stone (and a character attuned to it) can now "see" the location of the remaining Eye and the immediate area around it.
  - (This routes around a potential failure to figure out the location of the third Eye, and also speeds up the procedure of the third Eye Heist by essentially allowing the PCs to skip the normal surveillance requirements.)
- 3 EYES RESTORED: The Stone of Cazoch is fully restored and operates normally once again.

## Secrets Of The Stone Of Cazoch

- The Stone of Cazoch is a sentient magic item with an Intelligence of 18, a Wisdom of 16, and a Charisma of 18.
- It has hearing and darkvision out to a range of 120 feet.
- It can communicate telepathically with the creature that is attuned to it, as long as that creature understands at least one language.
- In addition, the Stone learns the greatest desires of any creature that communicates telepathically with it.
- Speaking with the Stone is difficult as its thought processes are alien.
  - As a result, the information it provides is often cryptic or vague.
- Legend Lore: The Stone of Cazoch has a maximum of 3 charges and regains `1d3-2` expended charges daily at dawn. While holding the Stone, you can expend 1 of its charges to cast the legend lore spell.
  - Using one of these charges, the Stone can share with its attuned holder the secrets which have been hidden inside of it, either through speech or through a telepathic burst of imagery and sensation. Its holder can direct this towards a particular secret if they are aware of its existence; otherwise the Stone will provide a secret according to its own perverse whim and alien predilection.
  - Examples of such secrets, ranging from the banal to the profound, include:
    - Any number of horrible racial slurs.
    - The elvish word `essylathir`, which means the beauty of eyes which are the color of a storm-tossed sea.
    - The existence of a race of tawny-haired bipeds known as `'fuzzies'` that live in the High Forest.
    - The Kingdom of `Otheria`, which ruled a demesne from the Sword Coast to the sands of `Anauroch`
      approximately 500 years ago.
    - The name 'Anu-Devan,' which was once the most popular male elven name.
    - The `Aurunean` Invasion. Strange invaders wearing insectile helmets of mithral-and-gold came from a continent far to the west and invaded `Faerûn`. Apparently the Stone was used to eradicate all knowledge of the war, thus ending the conflict (since it also eradicated the navigational charts the `Auruneans` had used to reach what they called the Eastern
      Shores).
    - The location of 16 bars of silver, buried in the rear yard of a tavern in `Murann` in 916 DR.
    - An atrocity performed during the Crown Wars. Although history has long-maintained that the dark elf `Ilythiiri` attacked the smaller kingdom of `Orishaar` on the thinnest of pretenses to begin the Second Crown War, it turns out that the `Orishaari` actually betrayed the `Ilythiiri` at a wedding which was to unite their two people and slaughtered most of the `Ilythiiri` royal family. The knowledge of this was wiped from history by the Stone of Cazoch, leaving the official histories to record only that the dark elves went to war 'in supposed retaliation for `Aryvandaar's` aggression against the `Miyeritari`. Considering that the moon elves of `Orishaar` had no connection with `Aryvandar` beyond a trade alliance, and the `Ilythiiri` had little to do with the beleaguered elves of `Miycritar`, this was a thinly veiled excuse for the `Ilythiiri` to seize some land from the moon elves.
    - The spells `blacksteel` and midnight shroud (see Spells of Light and Darkness).
    - The ritual required for the creation of a Hell cyst (see Part 3).
  - The existence of the `Shadowdusk` family, and their holdings on Level 22 of `Undermountain`. (Or perhaps some other hook to Dungeon of the Mad Mage.)
- Perceptive PCs may notice that many of these secrets were likely secured on `Toril` at a time when the Stone of Cazoch was supposedly being held in a vault on `Abeir`.
  - If they inquire on this topic, the Stone will reveal that when `Abeir` and `Toril` were reunited, it was ripped back in time to the point where the two worlds were sundered and then 'skipping' through time, appearing in `Toril` at various, discontinuous points through history.
- **Memory's Passing:** If you lose attunement with the Stone you must attempt a DC 16 Wisdom saving throw or the memories you shared with the Stone (i.e., the lost knowledge you gained from it) will begin to fade from your mind.
