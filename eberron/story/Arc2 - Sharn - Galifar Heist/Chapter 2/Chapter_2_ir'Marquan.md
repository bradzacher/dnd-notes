## [[ir'Marquan]]

- During their investigations, they will be contacted by a representative of the ir'Marquan family, asking for an audience at their villa.
- When the PCs arrive at the ir'Marquan estate:
  - They are given an opportunity to "accidentally" meet the ir'Marquan's children, who come running into the Entrance Hall (C1) while the PCs are waiting.
  - Lady ir'Marquan comes out personally to gather the PCs from the Entrance Hall and shoos the children away.
  - She leads the PCs to the Reading Room (Area C4), where they can look out over the Butterfly Garden (Area C25).
  - The children have scampered through the mudroom and are playing out there now.
    - Make sure to mention the black dragon head mounted on the wall of the room.
  - Lady ir'Marquan introduces her husband and they tell the PCs a modified version of their plight:
    - The twins were cursed at their birth by cultists of their lords of dust to lose their souls on their ninth birthday.
    - The ir'Marquan's have discovered a ritual which can save them, but it requires them to sacrifice "one shy of a million gold coins".
    - They are quite rich, but even in leveraging everything they own they still canâ€™t raise that monstrous sum.
    - If they could get their hands on ir'Demell's ill-gotten gains, though... Will the PCs please help them?
  - And then, of course, Lady ir'Marquan turns to gaze wistfully at her children frolicking with the butterflies.
