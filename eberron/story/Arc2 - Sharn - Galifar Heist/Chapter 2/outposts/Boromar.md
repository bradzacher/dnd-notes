# Boromar Outposts

## Interrogation House (Brindul Alley)

## Yellowspire

- Amath Seccent and her 4 acolytes are upstairs performing a ritual on a bound and gagged broadsheet publisher (Shan Chien).
  - Chien is shackled to the ground.
- The tower is encircled by wooden scaffolding.
  - Despite its precarious appearance, the scaffolding is secure and safe to walk on, enabling creatures to scale the outside of the tower without having to make ability checks.
  - The scaffolding rattles and creaks, however, and any creature that moves on it must succeed on a DC 16 Dexterity (Stealth) check or be heard by the tower's occupants.

> Seccent — I have nothing but contempt for what you have done.
> I don't know what foul rites you hope to perform,
> but the more traditional rites of Brindul Alley would have surely wrung any information this broadsheet publisher might have had.
> Nonetheless, Manshoon's word is my command, and so I present to you `Shan Chien`. May you choke on him.

- When the characters enter the basement, fate deals them an unkind hand as Manshoon's simulacrum arrives by way of the teleportation circle in area O5.
- If the characters had the opportunity and the foresight to destroy the circle prior to obtaining the stone, the simulacrum instead must travel to Yellowspire on foot, giving the characters ample time to get away before it arrives as long as they leave within 1 hour.
