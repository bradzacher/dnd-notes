# Boromar Hideout - Kolat Towers

## Surveillance

- External surveillance will show people passing through the force-field.
  - Some hold their amulet aloft as they pass through, though this is not strictly necessary.
  - Sometimes pairs and trios touch the leader as they move through.
- Internal surveillance requires passing through the shield.

## Features

- Kolat Towers is a multistory structure, with each level standing 20 feet higher than the one below it.
  - Its rooms have 15-foot-high ceilings, with 7-foot-high doorways connecting them.
- Climbing the outside walls without equipment requires a successful DC 15 Strength (Athletics) check.
- Each of the doors in the towers, as well as the door in the outer wall, is made of iron-bound oak and has AC 16, 27 hit points, and immunity to poison and psychic damage.
  - If a door is locked, it can be picked by a character who makes a successful DC 15 Dexterity check using thieves' tools
    - Or it can be forced open with a successful DC 20 Strength (Athletics) check.
  - Manshoon, Manafret Cherryport, and Havia Quickknife have keys to the locked doors.
- Windows have leaded frames and dirty glass panes.
  - They are latched from within and swing inward on iron hinges.
  - A successful DC 11 Dexterity check using thieves' tools opens a window from the outside.
- Unless otherwise noted, all areas are brightly lit by continual flame spells cast on wall sconces.
- Some of the staircases in Kolat Towers are invisible.
  - They are revealed by a see invisibility spell or similar magic.
  - A creature traversing stairs it can't see can move on the steps at half speed without any problem.
  - A creature that moves any faster than half speed must succeed on a DC 10 Dexterity (Acrobatics) check or slip, tumble down the stairs, and fall prone at the bottom of them.

## Lore

- Kolat Towers once belonged to two eccentric brothers, Duhlark and Alcedor Kolat. Both were wizards.
- Over time, the brothers discovered new ways to harness magic, but Duhlark became paranoid that others might steal their secrets.
  - He encased Kolat Towers in a magical force field.
- Duhlark's paranoia continued to grow, until he suspected Alcedor of selling their secrets
  - Alcedor left the towers, never to be heard from again, and Duhlark became a recluse who died in his own fortress.

## Questioning the Thugs

- Thugs know the general layout of the tower:
  - They've been told not to enter the Outer Tower or go above the third level of the Main Tower.
  - Manshoon's lieutenants wear special rings that let them access Manshoon's sanctuary atop the Outer Tower
    - Although they don't know that this is actually an extradimensional space; they think he just lives up there.
- Apprentice wizards know the same, but also know:
  - That Manshoon lives in an extradimensional sanctum.
  - He protects his valuables in an astral vault hidden somewhere in the sanctum.
    - His former fifth apprentice tried to gain access to it and was disintegrated when Manshoon caught him.
