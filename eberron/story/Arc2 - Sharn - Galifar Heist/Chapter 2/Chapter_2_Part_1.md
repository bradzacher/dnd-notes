## Investigation

### Searching The Bodies

- 2 of the dead bodies are halflings with the black snake tattoo.
  > Two small corpses - halfling, clad in dark clothing.
  > Both sporting black winged snake tattoos on their forearm.
- 1 of the bodies belonged to Dalakhar, a rock gnome under the employ of [[Cathan ir'Demell]].
  > A smaller corpse, a gnome wearing a heavy cloak and carrying a leather satchel.
  > The dead gnome has dry waste on his boots and cloak, suggesting he has spent time in the sewers recently.
  > He also has a pouch containing five 100 gp gemstones.
  - DC 13 Dexterity (Sleight of Hand) check to steal the pouch
    - On a failed check, the character still acquires the pouch, but someone observes the theft and reports it to City Watch constables once they show up.
- 1 of the bodies is an older human
  > A human, older, clouded eyes, toothless.
  > You recognise him as the party's first ever recruit, Claus.
- The remaining bodies are civilians:
  - An elderly female human who was out for a walk.
  - Two female half-elves, recognisable as locals - musicians
  - Two male half-elves, nearby the musicians.
    - Witnesses can attest to them dancing to the music.
  - Two warforged in servant attire with destroyed baskets.

### Witnesses

- The witnesses fall into one of 3 categories:

  1. Those who didn't see anything, and merely relate their personal experience. EG:
     - Heard a huge explosion, rushed into the street.
     - Saw a friend immolated in front of their eyes and the heat of the flame on their face.
     - All their windows blew out.
     - Et cetera.
  2. Those who saw the nimblewright throw a bead from a necklace of fireballs.
  3. Those who saw the nimblewright approach Dalakahar's body, take something from it, and run away.
     - If the PCs inquire about which direction it went, the answer is between two buildings and heading east.

- Description of the nimblewright

  - A construct made of both burnished copper and pale wood.
  - Wore a red robe and foppish red hat with a feather.
  - A long, stylized Van Dyke beard. (This is unique to the [[ir'Lanter]] nimblewright and may help identify it to Captain Zord later.)
  - You can see its clockwork mechanisms constantly whirring and pistoning under its rune-etched skin-plating.

- Fala Lefaliir
  - The owner of Corellon's Crown.
  - **Witness Type (3)**
    > I was watering plants in the greenhouse on the second floor of my shop when the blast blew out some of the windows.
    > Lucky I wasn't injured!
    > Through the smoke, I saw a weird thing take something from one of the bodies, then run away.
- Jezrynne Hornraven
  - A Sharn resident born of wealth and privilege, Jezrynne was leaving the Tiger's Eye having just hired Vincent Trench to spy on her philandering husband.
  - **Witness Type (2)**
    > I tell you, it was not a man.
    > More like a puppet shaped like a man.
    > A puppet without strings.
    > It was on the rooftop.
    > It hurled something into the crowd below that caused the explosion.
    > I saw those halflings burned alive! I saw them!
  - Jezrynne doesn't know what the 'puppet' hurled to cause the fireball.
    - She took her eyes off the thing during the chaos and doesn't know where it went.
- Martem Trec
  - This 12-year-old boy watched as his half-elf friends perished in the flames.
  - **Witness Type (2)**
    > Right after the explosion, I ducked behind a rain barrel.
    > Then I heard a 'plop' and found this in the barrel.
  - The object is the necklace of fireballs
    - He doesn't know what to make of this object but was planning to keep it.
    - A character can snatch it from him or convince Martem to relinquish it with a successful DC 8 Charisma (Intimidation or Persuasion) check.
- Rishaal
  - Gold Dragonborn - Owner of the Book Wyrm's Treasure
  - **Witness Type (1)**
    > I was sorting through and cataloguing a delivery of scrolls that had just come in.
    > Then next thing I knew my front window exploded inwards.
    > I ran outside to check and all I saw was this chaos.
- Meihomin
  - Street urchin, friend to the dead half-elves.
  - **Witness Type (1)**
    > My friends were just sitting there dancing and playing their music.
    > They were having a great time enjoying life.
    > Next thing I knew they were just... gone.
- Ulkoria Stonemarrow
  - Local drunkard - currently drunk
  - **Witness Type (3)**
    > Well I was just sitting there enjoying the show being _hic_ the show being put on in the street right there.
    > Then alls of a suddens there's this splosion and I'm thrown on me ass.
    > Then this weird copper robot thing shoves past me and starts rummaging through the bodies.
    > Then he just runs off like nobody's business.
    > I tells ya it's almost enough to drive a man to drink.
- Urstul Floxin
  - Member of Boromar Clan but survived the explosion.
  - Will give his real name as he is disoriented.
    > "I was coming to visit the book wyrm's treasure.
    > I don't know what happened exactly - there was this bright light and heat and..."
    > He touches the back of his head and stares at bit of blood on his fingers.
    > "... pretty sure I got knocked out for a bit."
  - DC13 Wisdom (Insight) to tell he's not telling the whole truth.
    > Look, I must have been hallucinating.
    > But just after the explosion, I could have sworn I saw a mechanical angel of death moving among the bodies.
    > I thought he was going to come for me next, but then it turned and ran away.

## The Watch Arrives

- 5 minutes - a small squad of 6 guards arrive at the scene and begin cordoning off the area.
  - They will keep an eye out and watch the bodies.
- 8 minutes - a City Guard Griffon rider is drawn over by the smoke.
  - It circles the towers and streets keeping an eye out for suspicious figures.
- 10 minutes - two House [[Jorasco (Healing)]] halflings arrive by carriage and start tending to the wounded.
- 15 minutes - 12 more guards plus a sergeant arrive and push the cordon back to either end of the alley.
  - The guards won't allow anyone in or out without permission from a superior officer.
- 20 minutes - Saeth Cromley and Barnibus Blastwind arrive on the scene with a contingent of 20 constables.
  - Saeth and Barnibus take control of the scene and begin coordinating everyone.
  - They begin door knocking and gathering statements.
- 30 minutes - [[Renaer ir'Demell]] arrives.
  - See the section below.

### Barnibus's Clues

- Barnibus takes the time to inspect the scene and read through the witness statements before allowing the bodies to be taken away.
- He draws the following conclusions, which he will keep to himself:
  - The gnome was running from armed pursuers, of which there were three. The third person who was chasing the gnome isn't among the dead.
  - The gnome and his pursuers were moving toward the tavern in Trollskull Alley (which Barnibus will soon come to realize is the characters' property).
  - Neither the gnome nor his pursuers saw the blast coming.
- Barnibus will seek to question the PCs.
  - They do not consider the PCs suspects as blowing up their place of business is hardly a plausible story right now.
- If the PCs ask to help the investigation, Barnibus refuses:
  > Thank you for the offer, but we must respectfully decline.
  > Please understand that that would introduce too many variables into an already confounding equation.
- If pressed, a DC15 Charisma (Persuasion) check presenting a truthful and honest demeanour can make Barnibus reveal his conclusions above.

### Renaer's Clues

- Renaer doesn't much about what happened, but he can relate the following:
  - He had arranged to meet with Dalakhar at the PC's place.
    - The gnome had sent him an urgent message requesting the meeting and Renaer chose the PC's place as the location.
  - Dalakhar was an agent working for his father.
  - His father had assigned Dalakhar to "keep an eye on me. He would skulk around and I would see him everywhere."
    - A few weeks ago, though, he abruptly disappeared and Renaer doesn't know where he's been.
    - (If the PCs ask, it happened just before Renaer was kidnapped by the Boromars.)
  - He doesn't know what Dalakhar wanted.
    - "His message simply said that he was carrying something valuable for my father, was unable to deliver it, and was hoping that I could help."

### Speak With Dead Clues

- If the PCs ask Dalakhar questions:
  - Dalakhar stole an artifact called the Stone of Cazoch from the lair of a beholder known as [[Xaejil]], in a dungeon deep below the city.
  - Dalakhar worked for the Open Lord of Sharn.
    - (Here he refers to Lord [[Cathan ir'Demell]], whom he believes is the rightful Open Lord, not [[Sava Kharisa]].)
  - The Stone of Cazoch is the key to finding a hoard of galifars hidden in the city.
  - Dalakhar heard about a group of adventurers who rescued Lord ir'Demell's son from the Boromar.
    - He thought the Stone of Cazoch would be safe in their hands for the time being.
    - He was on his way to deliver it to them, planning to come back and reclaim it after he had eluded his pursuers.
    - Then the fireball went off.
- If the PCs ask the dead Boromars questions:
  - Their names were Bashekk Ortallis and Wern Malkrave.
  - They worked for Urstul Floxin and resided at [[ir'Lanter]] Villa.
  - Their job was to help catch a gnome named Dalakhar.
  - Dalakhar had some kind of artifact in his possession which, according to Urstul Floxin, would make them as rich as kings.
