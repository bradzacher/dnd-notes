# Part 1 - Meeting Morkas

- Nyx will send the party to meet her contact, [[Morkas Flondriis]] - a Human Wizard at The Spooky Kitten tavern.
  - The Spooky Kitten is in lower dura.
  - She's been told by her contacts that Morkas has some information about what everything is looking for.

> You sit around a sturdy wooden table lit by a brightly burning candle and littered with plates cleared of food and half-drained tankards.
> The sounds of gamblers yelling and drunken adventurers singing bawdy songs nearly drown out the off-key strumming of a young bard three tables over.
>
> Then all the noise is eclipsed by a shout: "Ya pig! Like killin' me mates, does ya?"
> Then a burly halfling is hit by a wild, swinging punch from a stout goblin whose head is covered with eye-shaped tattoos.
> Four other goblins stand behind him, ready to jump into the fray.
> The halfling cracks her knuckles, roars, and leaps at the tattooed figure...
> But before you can see if blood is drawn, a crowd of spectators clusters around the brawl.

- The goblins are members of the Daask.
- The one with the eye-shaped tattoos is their leader, Krentz.
- Their foe, Yagra Strongfist, is a member of the Boromar Clan, who will fight for her pride.
- Possible PC choices:
  - Help Yagra:
    - For the larger PCs they'll be able to separate the pair easily.
    - Yagra will thank the PCs for their help, though she will be somewhat disappointed that she didn't get to finish the fight.
  - Help Krentz:
    - They really shouldn't do this because it's a 5v1 fight.. but who knows.
    - Easy to subdue Yagra or separate the fighters.
  - Do nothing:
    > You watch as the halfling quickly overpowers the tattooed goblin, grappling him to the ground.
    > A few quick punches to the face and the goblin stops resisting bloodied and alive.
    > The halfling isn't given a moment's reprieve, however, as the remaining goblins leap forward, pinning her to the ground.
    > As they begin beating her to a pulp from all angles...
- Regardless, the following occurs after the action:

> You hear the see the hulking half-orc bartender shove through the crowd.
> "Get the fuck out! NOW!" he roars over the commotion, as he makes to break up the fight.
> The goblins gather up their friend and rush out of the tavern without protest.
> The halfling is left lying on the ground, unconscious and beaten, but alive.
>
> You see a portly man wander through the doorway, his hat flopping about as he straightens himself.
> He glances around the room and a warm smile stretches across his face as he notices you.
>
> He strokes his bristling moustache, tightens his scarf, and then removes his hat as he sits down at your table.
> He gestures at the mess left on the ground "I haven't seen that much blood in a long time!"
> "Oh, but where are my manners...", as he gestures openly with his hands.
> "Morkas Flondriis; traveller, chronicler and wizard, at your service." he says with a nod.

- Allow the PCs to interact with him however they want.
- Morkas hasn't got much in the way of information.
  - He simply knows that [[Renaer ir'Demell]] was last seen with his friend Floon Blagmaar a few days ago.
  - He talks a lot more than is necessary to the point of rambling.

> "I don't know too much myself - I don't like to get too involved in this sort of business as it can lead you to..."
> As he gestures to the blood stained floor, "well, it isn't usually good."
> "A few days ago I was out drinking with my friend Floon Blagmaar.
> A great man Floon - he's got more beauty than brains, but he's a great drinking companion.
> The man could out-drink a dwarf I tell you." As he trails off for a second.
>
> "Right, sorry we were out drinking at the Skewered Dragon, a dark, bawdy tavern in Lower Tavick's.
> I called it an early night - well, early by Floon's standards," he says with a chuckle.
> "Floon remained and as I left I saw him take up a seat with a younger gentlemen dressed in finery.
> I didn't think much of it at the time, of course - he's a friendly sort and rarely drinks alone.
> But yesterday his wife tracked me down and told me that Floon never made it home.
> This was doubly surprising, as I had not previously been aware that he was married!" He lets out a hearty chuckle.
>
> "Let me get to the point. Thinking back about that man I saw.
> He was a bit more shaggy than I'd expect for his clothing, but he definitely does fit the description I've heard of Renaer.
> That paired with Floon going missing makes me think that the two might have gotten into some trouble together.
> If you can find Floon, you'll likely find Renaer, or at least Floon would have a lead for you."
>
> "Floon is a handsome man in his early thirties with wavy red-blond hair.
> He's not difficult to pick out of a crowd, however.
> He insists on always wearing a gaudy, 6-inch bas relief of a gold skull on a chain of blue pearls around his neck."

- The symbol is the symbol of the undying court, but they will find that out when they find it.
- If the players need some encouragement, Morkas will offer them the sum of 10 gold pieces.
