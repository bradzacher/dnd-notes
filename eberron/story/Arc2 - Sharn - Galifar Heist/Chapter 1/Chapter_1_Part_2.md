# Part 2 - Finding Floon

## Blood in the Streets

- En route to the Skewered Dragon, the PCs will happen upon a scene

> As you turn a corner, you find yourselves on a street that has been cordoned off by the City Watch.
> Lying on the cobblestones are a half-dozen goblinoid corpses, seemingly the victims of some terrible skirmish.
> Three blood-drenched halflings are kneeled on the ground, hands bound, staring coldly into the distance.
> Watch officers have disarmed and arrested the men and are in the midst of questioning witnesses.
> One of the officers sees you. "Get on," she says. "Nothing to see here."

- The watch won't let anyone get close.
  - Even the PCs with their deputy documents will be shooed away by the watch.
    > "That's all well and good, but we've got this handled. There's nothing for you to assist with here."
- Wait to see how the players react. If they choose not to probe the scene at all:
  - DC 12 Passive Perception.
  - They will notice that the 3 halflings have a tattoo on their arm - a black snake with wings.

## Looking for clues

> Tall, densely packed tenements leave most of the neighborhood in shadow at ground level.
> Most of the streetlamps have had their glass smashed and their candles stolen.
> The smells of damp, dank buildings and excrement linger as you pass by rows of run-down buildings.

## Questioning at the Skewered Dragon

> From the outside it looks crude, cold and nasty.
> Large and small stones and hard-wood beams make up most of the building's outer structure.
> It's hard to see through the large, dirty windows.
> As you enter the tavern through the old, metal door, you're welcomed by whispers and thick air.
> The bartender is talking to a customer and makes no effort to acknowledge your presence.
> It's as horrible inside as it is on the outside.
> Tree logs support the upper floor and the light fixtures attached to them.
> The walls are covered in photographs of what were undoubtedly better times for this tavern.
> They're now more of a painful reminder of what it has turned into.
> The few people inside are eerily silent, you're unsure if all of them are even alive.

- The evening regulars would be rolling back into the tavern.
- Several of the patrons would remember

## Canvassing the Neighbourhood

### Xoblob Shop

- Several people saw Floon and another man (Renaer) waylaid in front of the Old Xoblob Shop.

> A cloud of lavender-scented purple smoke trails out of the shop's door as you peer inside.
> Every wall is painted purple, and every dusty knickknack on the shelves is dyed a deep violet.
> The hairless old gnome sitting cross-legged on the counter wears plum-colored robes.
> His cheeks are decorated with nine purple face-painted eyes.
>
> The gnome lowers a pipe and exhales a cloud of lavender smoke before raising a hand.
> "Hail and well met! Come browse the shelves of the most curious curiosity shop in the world!"

- Xoblob is the name of the Gnome.
- He sells various trinkets.
  - A shard of obsidian that always feels warm to the touch
  - A small wooden statuette of a smug halfling
  - An old chess piece made from glass
  - A silver badge in the shape of a five-pointed star
  - A tiny silver bell without a clapper
  - A small box filled with different-sized buttons
  - A glass eye
  - A crystal knob from a door
  - A vial of blood
  - A petrified mouse
- Xoblob the Gnome can describe the attack.
  - If the PCs question him, he won't say much without some encouragement.
    - The PCs can spend a few gold pieces, offer him a purple item, or succeed on a DC 13 Charisma (Persuasion or Intimidation) check.
      > "Ah I remember now. A pretty man and a well dressed fellow were walking by outside," as he gestures outside the window.
      > "I didn't see what happened exactly, but it looked they were set upon by a group of ruffians.
      > A half dozen or so I think it was. They were pretty small... probably halflings or something..."
      > He says as he clearly strains to remember the details.
      > "Ah yes, and there was a hobgoblin with them I remember because he had a black tattoo on his neck."
      > "The two were taken away by the gang and that was the last I saw of any of them." He finishes, as he takes a long draw from his pipe.
    - If pressed, he'll remember it as the black winged snake tattoo.
- Searching outside the shop will turn up Floon's necklace - or rather just the golden skull. The chain of pearls is not attached.
  - See Tracking Floon's Necklace below.

### Questioning the Prisoners

- The PCs may backtrack to the _Blood in the Streets_ crime scene and figure out a way to talk to the Boromar agents being held by the city watch.
- If they can convince these agents to talk, they'll learn that they aren't local, but were told to report to the warehouse as a safe haven after performing the hit on the Daask.

### Tracking Floon's

- Floon kept his wits about him as he and Renaer were being kidnaped.
- Breaking the necklace around his neck, he let the blue beads drop into the streets and alleys as they were carried to the warehouse.
- PCs who find the unicorn's head in the street outside Xoblob's may be able to track the trail of beads back to the Boromar warehouse.

### Candle Lane

- Several locals have seen men with black tattoos up by the candle on Candle Lane.

> Gloom envelops a narrow alley as dark as a dungeon â€” and as odorous as one, too.
> Nearly all the streetlamps have been smashed.
> The only light that pierces the darkness is a faint flickering from down the lane, like a distant candle.

- Surveying the lane identifies the correct warehouse because it had a black winged snake painted above the front door's handle.
- Asking workers at the other warehouses along Candle Lane can also point them at the right warehouse.
  - They may also reveal that there was some kind of "ruckus" over there yesterday, with large groups of people coming and going.

## Boromar Hideout

> You approach a ramshackle, two-story warehouse at the end of the street.
> At the front of the warehouse is an empty yard enclosed by a fence and a metal gate.
> Inside the yard you can see the front-door, a dirty window, and a large metal loading door.
> Above the handle of the front gate you see the long faded and chipped relief of a winged snake.

- The gate is unlocked.
- Inside
- Making too much noise will alert the guards inside the building, causing them to get a surprise round.
  - It's nothing difficult (on purpose) - just 4 "Kenku"s.
  - These are just low-level thugs in the organisation, and are not intended to be strong.
- The doors or the window can be picked open with a DC12 lockpicking check or a DC10 Strength (Athletics) check.

### (Z1) Main Room

> Crates packed with weapons, rations, boots, black uniforms, and other gear fill the warehouse.

- If the kenku are alerted:
  > Tables and chairs have been carelessly tossed across the floor.
  > The corpses of a dozen halfling lie along the walls, their rapiers and daggers lying nearby.
  > On the north side of the area, stairs rise to an open level above.
- If the kenku are unaware:
  > Four short, avian creatures with long beaks and black feathers look over in surprise from where they stand in the middle of the warehouse.
  > Each wears a hooded cloak and wields a shortsword.
- Either way, the kenku attack immediately.
  - The kenku fight until two of them are out. Then the remainder will attempt to run.
  - If captured, a DC10 Charisma (Intimidation) check can get them to talk.
    - In a deep voice with an orcish accent: "The Daask send their regards."
    - In a thin, nasally voice: "Tie up the pretty boy in the back room!" and "Follow the yellow signs in the sewers."
      - (This remark refers to tunnels in the sewers that are marked with the Daask's symbol where they lead to the Daask's Guild hideout.)
    - In a scratchy voice: "No time to loot the place. Just get him to the boss."
- Read the "alerted" description after the combat if the kenku were caught unawares.
- When the PCs search the room, they'll find an elaborate, ivory locket, etched with the silhouette of a woman.
  - The locket has been broken open, and inside is a small component that is (now) empty.

### (Z2) Storage Closet

> The door to this back room hangs loosely on broken hinges.
> The cramped chamber beyond smells strongly of sour fish and vinegar.
> It is filled with discarded ropes, canvas tarpaulins, and splintered wood from smashed barrels
> Inside you hear the sound of ragged breathing coming from underneath a tarpaulin at the end of the room.

- Renaer is hiding here.
  - He is unharmed, but is marred by grim and the lingering stench of rancid pickled herring.
  - He speaks with grace and articulation.
  - If the characters ask him to help search, he'll agree to do so and grab a dagger and a rapier from the dead Boromars.
  - If asked why he was kidnapped:
    > "The Boromar thinks that my father embezzled a large amount of gold while he was the Lord Mayor, and that he hid the galifars somewhere in the city.
    > They think that I know where it was hidden and that I can help them get the gold, but I don't have any idea about that.
    > My father and I haven't spoken in years.
    > They tore my mother's locket from around my neck and left me alone and bound."
  - If asked about the locket:
    > Renaer looks sadly upon the broken locket.
    > "The locket belonged to my mother. My father gave it to me when after she died.
    > I've carried it with me everywhere for a few years now.
    > My mother was very special to me, and I miss her very dearly.
    > I don't understand though, it looks like it's been opened.
    > It looks like it had compartment inside it.
    > I didn't know it held anything."
    - DC12 Wisdom (Insight) check can tell that Renaer is both sad and angry.
      - If questioned, he will let on that he thinks the necklace never belonged to his mother, and that his father had lied to him.

### (Z3) Secret Room

- The room can be found with a DC15 Wisdom (Perception) check.
- When the door is opened, the PCs can hear the faint sound of a bell ringing upstairs.
- Treasure:
  - There are two wooden crates here containing stolen goods.
  - The first crate stores are 4 wood-framed paintings wrapped in leather worth 75gp each.
  - The second crate holds fifteen 10-bound silver bars, blackened by corrosion, but still worth 50gp each.

### (Z4) Balcony

> The open second level is stacked with crates where it overlooks the main warehouse.

- The crates contain junk such as rotten and spoiled food, moth-eaten bolts of cloth, and hundreds of pairs of wooden-soled sandals that were all the rage last summer but are now out of fashion.
  - The junk is worthless.

### (Z5) Offices

> On the northern side of the second floor sits a series of rooms.
> Through the dirty and cracked windows you can see that they appear to be a set of offices.
> The offices appear to be are choked with dust and draped with spiderwebs.

- There is a steel bell on the wall with wires running down the wall and through the floor.
  - This is a hint in case the players haven't found the secret room yet.
- If they search the office they find one unused paper bird item
