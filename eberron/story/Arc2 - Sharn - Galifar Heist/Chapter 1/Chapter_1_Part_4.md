# Part 4 - Completion

- The characters can return to the Spooky Kitten to meet with Morkas.

> "I confess that I have but few coins to spare. But never let it be said that Morkas reneges on a promise.
> Allow me to present something much more valuable."
> He holds out a scroll tube.
> "The deed to a remarkable property here in Sharn!
> We'll need a magistrate to witness the transfer of ownership.
> I'll arrange a meeting with one after you've inspected the estate and deemed it satisfactory."

- The tube contains a deed to Trollskull Manor, a historic building in Sunrise in Upper Tavick's.
- The deed has been notarized and appears legitimate.
- If the characters accept their reward, Morkas sets up a meeting with a tiefling magistrate named Kylynne Silmerhelve.
  - The brief session takes place at a courthouse in middle central at noon.
  - Magistrate Silmerhelve witnesses the transfer of the deed, rendering the new ownership official, with the impatience of one who has more important matters to attend to.
  - She also collects an estate transfer tax of 25 gp, which is normally paid by the new owners.
    - If the characters can't afford this fee or don't want to pay it and they have befriended Renaer ir'Demell, he makes sure that Morkas has a pouch of coins to cover the expense.
- Morkas, Floon, and Renaer all express their gratitude through camaraderie.
  - If the characters need to call upon their new friends for an occasional favor, any of them are happy to oblige.
  - Floon has little to offer the characters, but friendship with Morkas and Renaer has its perks.
  - Morkas knows the best places to eat and find merriment. He can also give characters a tour of Sharn.
  - Although Renaer is estranged from his rich and powerful father, he still has friends in high places.
    - Including Harpers who can come to the characters' rescue if they need it.
    - If the characters are looking for an audience with influential persons in Sharn
      - Renaer can set up meetings with Mirt, Remallia d'Medani, or just about any other Sharn noble, if he thinks the characters will comport themselves well.
