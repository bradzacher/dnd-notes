# Chapter 1 - A Friend in Need

## Part One: Lady in Distress

### Employment Opportunity

> The rain has returned after a few welcome days of sun, and now the steady beat of water falling on the roofs and nearby
> suspended walkways fills the air with constant noise.
> The door opens as one of your guards enters, closely followed by one of Sharn's gargoyle messengers.
> Rain runs in rivulets down the creature's stony hide, reminiscent of the way it cascades down the stone towers of the city.
> A House Vadalis signet hangs from the harness around the gargoyle's chest.

- The gargoyle will approach the PCs

> "The Lady has need of you," the gargoyle says in a raspy voice that sounds like stones being scraped together.
> He reaches into the pouch slung over his shoulder and drops a sealed envelope onto the table.
> With a nod, the gargoyle turns and disappears out the door - back into the rain-filled city.

- The envelope is made of high-quality paper and features a wax seal with the House Cannith seal pressed into it.
- The enclosed letter reads:

> Friends,
> Another opportunity to earn gold and perform a service for House Cannith presents itself.
> Please meet me at my town house at the sound of the second evening chime.
> Come to the Parlan Tower in Middle Central, Town House 19.
> Lady E.

### Town House 19

> Something looks wrong as you approach Lady Elaydren's town house.
> The open door, the scattered papers, and the smashed windows indicate that something violent occurred recently.
> A shadow moves in the doorway.
> You hear a loud crash and the sound of wood splintering, followed by a woman's scream.

- Elaydren's home is currently occupied by 5 Karrnathi Undead Soldiers.
- 2 are searching the house and 3 are breaking into to Elaydren's room.
  - When the PCs enter one is on top of Elaydren attacking her.
- The soldiers fly into battle with the PCs with battle cries from raspy voices:
  - "For Karrn and Karrnath!"
  - "By the Blood-Sword's crimson blade!"
  - "You are no match for the blood and soil of Karrnath!"
- The soldiers will fight the PCs when they notice them.
  - The ones that are near Elaydren will move to finish her off.
  - When attacked, the soldier will turn their focus to the attacker and off of Elaydren.

### Time Is Of The Essence

> "Once again I am in your debt," Lady Elaydren says as she tries to compose herself after the brutal ordeal.
> "The undead were only part of the larger force that attacked my guards and household staff.
> There were armored warriors wearing the symbol of the Emerald Claw, and a warforged fighter with a wickedly curved scimitar.
> The worst of these, however, was their leader.
> He appeared first as a smiling merchant, rotund and jolly, who used so innocent a form to gain entry to my town house.
> Then his form seemed to melt and flow, and he appeared as a tall, emaciated man with white skin, red eyes, and sharp fangs.
> I think it must have been Garrow, based on the descriptions you've given of him."
>
> "They killed my guards, my servants... they smashed my pre-Galifar memory urn... and they took the schemas," Elaydren recounts with a heavy heart.
> "By the Great Forge, the Emerald Claw has the schemas and the creation pattern!"
> She pauses again, and a new resolve sparkles in her sapphire eyes.
> "There is still time to retrieve the schemas and keep the Order of the Emerald Claw from gaining whatever power the completed creation pattern may possess.
> Time is of the essence, and there isn't a moment to waste.
> Will you undertake this mission for me?"

- Answers to some questions:
  - Why Should We Help You?
    > "For taking on this mission, I will pay you 3,000 gold pieces each.
    > Half now, and the rest when you return with the items.
    > The schemas and the creation pattern belong to House Cannith, but more importantly, we must not allow the Order of the Emerald Claw to use the completed pattern.
    > I haven't quite determined what the pattern can be used to create, but the reputed power it possesses cannot be allowed to fall into the grasp of the Emerald Claw.
    > Neither the Five Nations nor the dragonmarked houses will be safe should the order attain a powerful weapon.
    > They have three of the four schemas.
    > They can't be allowed to retrieve the fourth."
  - Why Us and Not House Cannith Operatives?
    > "I was given the schemas and the creation pattern to hold and keep safe, and I have failed.
    > I must recover the items through the efforts of my own resources, or my standing in the house will be in jeopardy.
    > You have served me well in the past, and I turn to you again in this hour of need."
  - How Can We Find the Schemas?
    > "Among the items stolen from me were recently uncovered notes made by my ancestor, Kedran d'Cannith.
    > It was in his ancient forge far below Sharn that the first schema was discovered.
    > His notes hint at the location of the fourth schema.
    > I can provide you with those hints, and you can beat the Emerald Claw to the location."
  - Where Do You Think the Fourth Schema Is?
    > "The fourth schema can be found in Xen'drik, in ancient ruins once populated by giants and their elf slaves.
    > Kedran's notes clearly identify the place, and I can replicate the clues that were among his writings."
  - What's Next?
    > "Prepare yourselves for a journey to the mysterious continent of Xen'drik.
    > Here is a letter of credit for 5,000 gold pieces that you should use to outfit yourselves and procure potions and scrolls for the expedition.
    > Return here in two hours, and I will have your advance payment ready.
    > I will also make arrangements for your travel."

## Part 2 - From Here to There

- The PCs can return to Elaydren's house in 2 hours.

> As you approach Lady Elaydren's townhouse you hear a loud banging followed the sound of shattering glass.
> As you spring around the corner, you hear a portly dwarf launch into a series of dwarfish curses towards a human hanging out of the window.
> On the ground you see the shattered remnants of a window as a goblin rushes over dragging a large bin and a broom behind them.

- DC 15 Passive Perception will notice that none of the labourers are wearing House Cannith livery.
  - DC 15 Intelligence (Investigation) or Wisdom (Insight) check will let a PC infer that Elaydren is probably hiding the attack from the House.
  - If questioned - Elaydren will be a bit defensive, but will quickly concede the point.
    - She didn't want news of her failure to reach her Baron.
    - At least, not until she had a chance to set in motion actions to correct it.
- Elaydren seems relieved to see the party.

> I have secured you passage on a new form of transportation recently developed by House Cannith,
> It is called an undersea ship, for it travels secretly beneath the waves.
> Three such vehicles have been constructed.
> We built them for various intelligence agencies, but only one such group has had the vision to purchase one of the ships now that the Last War has ended.
> The other two remain in Cannith hands.
> Take this letter of passage to [[Byam]], in the Grayflood district.
> He can be found in the vicinity of the Stone Docks.
> He will make sure you get safely to [[Stormreach]] and back again.

- Let them ask any questions

> The undersea ship will take you to Stormreach, the trading town located on the northern coast of Xen'drik.
> You might be able to pick up the Emerald Claw task force's trail in or around Stormreach.
> If that doesn't seem to be working, you should instead head directly for the ruins.
> Kedran's notes place the ancient site about four hundred miles up the Rachi River.
> Here is the clue from Kedran's notes to finding the site once you reach that stretch of the river:
>
> "At the turn in the Rachi River,
> where the land rises and the hands of stone reach for the sky,
> look toward the giant's left hand for guidance to the schema's resting place."
>
> A bit vague for me, but it's what we've got to go on.

- Let them ask any questions.

> Before I forget, as promised - here is your advance payment.
> Collect the four schemas and the creation pattern, return them to me, and an equal amount will be yours on your return.
> Good luck, and may the fortunes of the Houses and the Nations smile upon you.

- She hands each of the PCs a sack filled with 1,500gp worth of small gems.
