- DC11 Intelligence (Investigation) or Wisdom (Survival) to find the sewer entrance without information.
- 5gp of bribes also works.

> A putrid stream flows along this sewer tunnel, which leads in two directions.

- DC12 Wisdom (Perception) check to notice the chalk marks:
  > In one direction, you see a tiny symbol drawn on the wall in yellow chalk:
  > a palm-sized circle with ten equidistant spokes radiating out from its circumference.
- They must make 3 DC13 Wisdom (Survival) checks to navigate the sewers.
  - Each failure wastes 1 hour.
  - Roll with advantage if they noticed the chalk marks.

> After an hour of following signs through the tunnels, you come to a three-way intersection.
> A ladder leads up into a stone shaft capped by a circular metal cover.
> One of the familiar chalk symbols is marked on a wall nearby. and f
> Floating near the symbol is a spherical, grapefruit-sized creature with a bulging central eye and four stumpy eyestalks.

  - The players must defeat it to continue.

## Daask Guild Hideout

### (Q1) Central Hub

> The main sewer tunnel expands into a circular hub with a pair of arrow slits carved into its outer walls, directly across from each other.
> Two passages continue on to the north and south.
> A stone door is set into the back wall of a stone ledge to the west.

- If the characters talk loudly or otherwise make a lot of noise here:
  - The goblin sentries in areas Q2a and Q2b awaken and shoot arrows at them through the arrow slits.
  - The slits provide the goblins with three-quarters cover.
  - DC9 Dexterity (Stealth) check to pass by unseen.
- The secret door in the southern tunnel can be found with a DC15 Wisdom (Perception) check.

### (Q2) Watch Posts

- Two goblins are stationed here, one in area Q2a and one in Q2b.
  - Each goblin contains 1d6cp

### (Q3) Messy Room

> Rusty weapons and threadbare clothing litter the floor of this area, which serves as a coat room and armory.

- It contains nothing of value.

### (Q4) Empty Sleeping Area

> This room contains six tattered, straw-stuffed mattresses.

- If the occupant or occupants of area Q5 have not been dealt with already:
  > You hear the sounds of activity in through the wooden door.

### (Q5) Sleeping Area

> This room contains six tattered, straw-stuffed mattresses.
> You see a gray dwarf and a heavily bruised and tattooed goblin in the corner arguing.
> "What are you doing?"
> "I'm barricading the door, what does it look like?"
> "No you can't just barricade the door you idiot! It'll just slip underneath."
> "Well do you have a better idea then genius?"
> "What about some blankets or something?"

- Zemk the duergar will fight to the death.
- Krentz the goblin will attempt to surrender or flee once Zemk dies.

### (Q6) Lavatory

> You open the door to a rank smelling room.
> Some pitted and half melted weapons lie on the floor.
> In the middle of the room is a roiling mass of grey fluid.
> You watch as the liquid flows and gains a rough, blob form.
> Suspended in the form you see bones.

- The ooze will attack. None of the gear is salvageable.

### (Q7) Boss Fight

> Threadbare curtains hang on the east wall of a long hall.
>
> In the middle of the hall a muscular half-orc in dingy robes stands with his foot on the chest of a half-elf with wavy red-blond hair.
> Fire burns around the orc's clenched fist, and his victim cries and squirms helplessly beneath him.
>
> Seated on a raised platform to the south is a nightmarish figure wearing black robes.
> It has large white eyes and rubbery purple skin, with four tentacles encircling its inhuman mouth.
> It cradles and gently caresses what looks like a disembodied brain with feet.

- The tentacled creature is Nihiloor, a mind flayer that is caressing an intellect devourer.

- Nihiloor expects Grum'shar and the intellect devourer to cover its escape.
- Nihiloor carries a 3-inch-diameter stone orb carved to resemble an eyeball, similar to what one might see at the end of a beholder's eyestalk.
  - This stone eye is the key to activating the magic portal in area (Q11).
- It uses dominate monster to control someone who gets in its way and turns any such individuals against their allies.

> You watch the creature place its pet down, slowly stand, and then begin gliding down the stairs towards the door.
> Its pet scampers excitedly after it.

- The half-orc is Grum'shar, a low-end Daask Guild boss.
  - As soon as his minions retrieved who they thought was Renaer ir'Demell, the half-orc begged Nihiloor let him witness the interrogation of the captive, not realizing until after he did so that he had mistaken the prisoner's identity.
  - Grum'shar attacks the characters in the hope of salvaging his reputation.
- Treat the goblins as "minion" monsters - only taking 1 hit to kill.
- Floon is on 1 hit point, and will not fight.
  - Renaer will move to protect floon, and will shoulder the burden of carrying him after combat.

### (Q8) Getaway Passage

- This room looks empty.
- A thorough search accompanied by a successful DC 10 Wisdom (Perception) check reveals a rough-hewn tunnel hidden beneath a loose flagstone.
  - The low tunnel leads north to area Q9.

### (Q9) Private Cellar

> The tunnel leads you about 30 feet before coming to a dead end.
> Above you is another flagstone, similar to the one you entered through.

- An innocent halfling family, the Peabodys, brews beer in this cellar, which lies beneath their home on Fishgut Alley in the Dock Ward.
- Their cellar contains brewing supplies and lots of worthless clutter.

> It takes a good big of effort, but you are eventually able to lift the heavy flagstone.
> As you unseal the tunnel, your nose is immediately filled with the scent of yeast and hops.
> A startled halfling looks at you with wide eyes.

- The halflings can be calmed down easily.
- The halflings haven't noticed the secret tunnel that leads to the Daask Guild hideout.
  - It's concealed beneath a large flagstone that requires a Strength score of 10 or higher to be lifted.
- They will agree to seal it up after the PCs leave.

### (Q10) Sleeping Quarters

> Straw pallets lie on the floor, and rusty manacles are bolted to the walls.

### (Q11) Back Door

> In the middle of this otherwise empty room is a stone pillar carved with a small symbol:
> a perfect circle with ten equidistant spokes radiating outward from its circumference.
> In the middle of this circle is a smaller circular indentation that bears a passing resemblance to a lidless eye.

- If the stone eye in Nihiloor's possession is pressed into the circular indentation, an opaque black doorway magically opens in the south wall.
  - The doorway is a one-way portal that leads to the main Daask hideout.
- The "secret" door is perfectly visible from this side.

### (Q12) Hostel Cellar

> You see a narrow passage in the wall.
> A hair over a foot across, it'd be a tight squeeze for you to fit through.
> The other end is dark and difficult to see.

- This is the storeroom of the "The Chunky Yam" hostel in the Dock Ward.
  - The hostel is used as a base by the Shard Shunners, a gang of halfling wererats.
    - They are aware of the Daask Guild hideout, and the two gangs are tenuous allies.
- Roscoe Underbough, a Shard Shunner in hybrid form, guards the cellar.
  - He hides in the northwest storeroom, ready to jump out and scare away anyone who heads for the stairs.
  - Not eager to commit murder, Roscoe allows retreating characters to flee back to the sewers.
- If the characters defeat Roscoe or slip past him, they can make their way up into the hostel, which caters to a mostly halfling clientele.
  - With none of the other Shard Shunners currently present, the characters are greeted warmly by staff and patrons, who point them in the direction of the nearest bathhouse.
