# Fabim Mohla

17 years old.

Fabim grew up in a poor environment as the only son of his mother, who had an affair with somebody from a rich and powerful family. His fathers side doesn't acknowledge him and he is driven to acquire wealth and try to prove that he doesn't need them. But that's not something he tells anybody (note: not even the party, at least in the beginning). For most people, he plays the rich kid who is looking for adventures not because he needs to but just because it's fun. He doesn't care too much about honesty or truth and will say whatever he thinks will get him what he wants or makes him look better.

He is looking up to and envies adventurers, especially ones with lots of cool abilities that he doesn't have. He is looking for such a group, the more powerful the better, and hopes they'll take him with them despite his lack of abilities.
He isn't aware of any special abilities that make him fit for an adventurers life, but his quick reactions and wits have always gotten him out of any difficult situation so far. At least that's what he tells himself. In reality, he has memory blackouts whenever he gets into a difficult situation and doesn't really know how he got out of them (background: he's a barbarian shifter and that's his rage, he or his mother doesn't know anything about his shifting and his mother isn't a shifter, but his dad was)
