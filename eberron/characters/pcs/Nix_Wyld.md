## Story

Grown up on the streets Sharn I was found wandering and picked up by a underground organization of smugglers and “unsavory types” who are for hire on odd jobs around the city

I haven't met other changelings but have heard stories of their potential as great thieves, investigators, sex workers and high profile roles working for dragonmarked families.

I was born to a mother who died of a fever, but I know it was a surprise to her for me to be a changeling. She only let me road-test my skills in secret and i maintained a single-skin life until she died.

After 10 years in the “smuggling ring” a recent job caused a tunnel to collapse trapping my friend Reeva.

In that moment I was able to find “power” to lift the rock and help her get out.

Realizing how the ring would react to me having power, and the potential for exploitation as others with power in the group are forced into risky jobs and lifetime of service with less freedom, I left at that moment. Reeva couldn't come with me as she had family in the ring, so I went out on my own, looking for a new start.

- Last job was for a lot of money.
- Included a contract.
- You don't break a contract.
