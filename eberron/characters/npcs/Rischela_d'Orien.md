Location

- [[Sharn]]

Factions

- [[Orien (Passage)]]

Magic has always come easy to Rischela. After studying at the Arcanix, she headed directly to House Orien's teleportation research division.

Rischela sees a future in which teleportation circles between major cities are in regular use, but she is skeptical as to whether it is the primary way forward for her house if they are to successfully compete with House Lyrandar's growing fleet of airships. Instead, she sees a future for the lightning rail cutting travel times dramatically through a combination of increasing speed and developing shortcuts through either Khyber or interplanar travel.

Few in the house see eye-to-eye with her, thinking her plan is far too dangerous and unstable. As a result, Rischela spends a good bit of time on teleportation research, but she would be eager to serve as a patron for enterprising trailblazers who believe they could find a short path from one end of Khorvaire to the other through Khyber... or elsewhere. After one too many interplanar trips to an inhospitable environment, Rischela has taken to wearing a necklace of adaptation. She often has spell scrolls for spells relevant to her research, such as rope trick, Leomund's secret chest, or dimension door.

Rischela has a familiar named Farskil â€“ a fey creature that typically takes the form of a bright-yellow, foot-long gecko.
