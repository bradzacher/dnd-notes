Hallmarks

- Dungeons, goblinoid mercenaries, ruins

Goblins and their kin have always been part of Khorvaire. Their ancient empire spread across the lands now held by other nations, and goblin foundations still stand underneath many human cities. This empire collapsed into savagery, and when humans arrived from Sarlona, they drove the goblins from their ancestral lands. Thus, goblins have long been a disenfranchised people, living in the shadows of newer nations or in wild lands shunned by humans.

The land now called Darguun was once part of Cyre. The hobgoblin clans known as the Ghaal'dar were based in the Seawall Mountains, but during the war, the demand for mercenaries drew an ever-increasing number of goblins out of the mountains to fight for Cyre and Breland. Late in the war, a brilliant hobgoblin named Lhesh Haruuc Sharaat'kor recognized that the goblins had become the dominant military power in the region. Uniting the Ghaal'dar under his banner, Haruuc seized the territory he was supposed to protect. The Five Nations were unprepared, and Breland quickly negotiated an alliance with Haruuc to secure the border. Cyre fought the goblins until the Day of Mourning, but the majority of delegates involved in forging the Treaty of Thronehold chose to recognize the new nation of Darguun to ensure peace.

Darguun is a young and volatile nation, ruled by Lhesh Haruuc Sharaat'kor. Haruuc remains a brilliant strategist and tactician, but many wonder whether he can maintain the web of alliances that hold the Ghaal'dar together, and whether he and his people will be content to abide by the terms of the treaty. Other goblins still hidden in the mountains—the enigmatic Heirs of Dhakaan (see chapter 4)—could pose a threat both to the goblins and the rest of Khorvaire.

Traditionally, the Ghaal'dar worshiped a form of the Dark Six. House Deneith introduced the Sovereign Host to the region, and some goblins have embraced this faith, especially the gods Dol Dorn, Dol Arrah, and Balinor.

## Interesting Things About Darguun

- House Deneith has a strong presence in Darguun. No one will employ goblin armies in the wake of Haruuc's betrayal, but security forces value smaller units of goblinoid mercenaries for their ferocity and skills.
- Darguun is a frontier nation. Although recognized by the Treaty of Thronehold, it doesn't abide by the common laws of the treaty nations. Law enforcement is unpredictable, and acts considered criminal in other nations are part of life in Darguun.
- A number of bugbear-dominated clans known as the Marguul inhabit southern Darguun. Some of the Marguul refuse to acknowledge the authority of the Ghaal'dar hobgoblins; these clans are especially dangerous and violent.
- Lhesh Haruuc united the Ghaal'dar clans and seized control of Darguun nearly three decades ago. If you are a non-goblin from this land, you may have been born in captivity. Were you forced into bondage, or did you adopt Darguul customs and earn a place in their society?

## Darguul Characters

- Darguun is a logical point of origin for goblin, hobgoblin, or bugbear characters. When creating a Ghaal'dar character from Darguun, consider the following:
- Constant Struggle. Among the Ghaal'dar, you must constantly prove your strength and skill to gain and hold the respect of your kin. Ghaal'dar rarely kill in a casual battle; you might fight to prove a point but kill only when you must.
- Loyal to Your Clan. Challenge your peers as you like in times of peace, but when blades unsheathe for war, you stand by your clan—or those allies you have bonded with—until death. This loyalty doesn't extend to warriors of other Ghaal'dar clans.
- Muut and Atcha. Your ancestors once forged an empire even greater than Galifar. Perhaps you believe that your people can reclaim this lost glory. The Dhakaani were renowned for their martial skill and their discipline. Muut roughly translates to “duty”—your duty to your empire, your clan, and your commander. Muut is expected; if you have no muut, you have no place in battle. Atcha corresponds to "honor," especially your personal honor gained by virtuous deeds that transcend the expectations of muut.

## Aftermath of the Last War

Darguun was born in the Last War, and the scars of its birth are still raw. Most of the Cyran population fled the goblin uprising, and those who remained were killed or enslaved. As a result, many burnt-out farms and abandoned villages have stood empty for decades. The broken paths of the lightning rail make travel into the interior difficult, and only the largest cities offer the basic services common elsewhere in the treaty nations.

Any significant settlement is likely the domain of a single Ghaal'dar clan. While these clans give their fealty to Lhesh Haruuc, every clan lord holds absolute power in their town. Some clans are friendly to outsiders and welcome commerce. Others despise non-goblins. Lhesh Haruuc has abolished slavery in Rhukaan Draal, but some of clan lords continue this practice.

Overall, Darguun is a nation that is still finding its identity—a kingdom that seeks to be more than a seized territory. The goblins carry the legacy of a mighty empire and stand in the shadow of the nations around them. Haruuc wants to draw out the best in his people, to harness their strengths and achieve their potential. The rest of Khorvaire waits to see if the Ghaal'dar have the will to remain a nation, and if Darguun can survive when Haruuc passes away.
