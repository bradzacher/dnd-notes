# Breland

Capital

- Wroat

Hallmarks

- Espionage, industry, metalwork, organized crime, subterfuge

In the wake of the Last War, Breland is one of the most powerful nations in Khorvaire. Possessing a large population and abundant resources, Breland leads the continent in industry.

The Brelish are known for their pragmatism and independence. They lack the discipline of Karrns and the faith of the Thranes, but they excel at finding innovative solutions to problems. The Brelish also have a talent for intrigue and subterfuge. The King's Dark Lanterns is one of the finest intelligence agencies in Khorvaire, rivaled only by House Phiarlan and the Trust of Zilargo. The dark side of these aptitudes is a strong streak of cynicism, which allows crime and corruption to flourish in Brelish cities and temples. The Sovereign Host is the dominant religion of Breland, but in general the Brelish aren't as devout as citizens of other nations.

King Boranel ir'Wynarn rules Breland in conjunction with an elected parliament. Boranel is a popular leader celebrated for his exploits during the Last War, but his children have yet to prove themselves, and a growing movement advocates for abandoning royal rule when Boranel passes.

## Interesting Things About Breland

- Sharn is the largest city in Khorvaire. Almost a nation in its own right, the City of Towers is a hub for commerce and intrigue. Chapter 3 provides more information on Sharn.
- The Boromar Clan is the oldest and most powerful criminal organization in Breland. The Boromar halfling leadership maintains ties to the Talenta Plains. Other notable criminal organizations include the monsters of Daask and House Tarkanan, an alliance of assassins and thieves with aberrant dragonmarks (see chapter 4 for more about these crime syndicates).
- Breland's major cities are highly cosmopolitan. Due to its proximity to Droaam, Breland's cities include more monsters—ogres, orcs, goblins, and even sahuagin, harpies, and gargoyles—than elsewhere in the Five Nations.

## Brelish Characters

As you develop a Brelish character or NPC, consider the following qualities:

- Slightly Shady. Many Brelish have a loose relationship with the law. Even if you're a hero, you might have questionable connections or friends in low places. Backgrounds such as criminal, spy, or charlatan can reflect this tendency, regardless of your class. You could also be a folk hero who challenges the laws to protect the innocent, or an entertainer who plays in every dive in Sharn.
- Innovative and Independent. Find your own path in the world; don't simply follow established traditions. As a cleric, you might challenge your church and follow your own divine revelations. As a wizard, you could search for new techniques or attempt to unravel forgotten secrets.
- Practical. Whether it's about fashion, food, or conversation, the Brelish tend to be pragmatic. Why spend a fortune on a fancy meal when a simple one will do? You use whatever tool gets the job done, and you don't see a need for unnecessary flair.

## Aftermath of the Last War

For Breland, the Last War was an ever-shifting tangle of enemies and alliances. Breland fought Aundair, Cyre, Karrnath, and Thrane at various points of the war, as well as clashing with Darguun and Droaam. These conflicts caused many Brelish to embrace a cynical view of the world, a sense that no one can be fully trusted and that people need to look out for themselves. As a Brelish character, you could have an axe to grind against any of the other nations. This is balanced against a strong belief in humanoid rights and dignity, convictions that motivated the Brelish to shelter more Cyran refugees than any other nation.
The major cities of Breland host significant populations of refugees, both Cyrans and Brelish from villages lost in the war. This has increased the overall level of poverty and desperation and contributed to an increase in crime. The southern cities—including Wroat and Sharn—suffered relatively little damage in the war, but northern Breland was hard hit. The city of Vathirond is still repairing the damage from Thrane attacks, and many northern villages are either recovering or have simply been abandoned.
Despite these struggles, the Brelish maintain a positive view of their future. The heart of Breland is as strong as it ever was, and the citizens believe that had the war continued, Breland would have triumphed.
