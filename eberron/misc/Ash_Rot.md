# Ash Rot

This magical disease shows no immediate symptoms, and those who have been infected by it may be unaware of it for some time.

- Symptoms begin to manifest after 2d4 days or when an infected creature takes fire damage.
- Symptoms, once they manifest, include fatigue and skin that flakes off in ash-like particles to reveal rotting flesh below.
- An infected creature gains a level of exhaustion that can't be removed until the disease is cured.
- Additionally, whenever a creature infected by ash rot takes fire damage, it takes an additional amount of necrotic damage equal to one-half the fire damage taken, as its body wants to turn into ash.
- At the end of each Long Rest, an infected creature must make a DC 14 Constitution saving throw.
  - On a failed save, the creature only gains the benefit of a Short Rest instead of a Long Rest and takes 2d6 necrotic damage.
  - On a successful save, the creature takes half as much damage and gains the benefits of the Long Rest.
  - If a creature succeeds on this save three days in a row, it recovers from the disease.
- Ash rot is a magical disease and is, thus, resistant to normal cures.
  - During its symptomless incubation period, it can be cured by lesser restoration.
  - Otherwise, lesser restoration can be used to count a day on which a creature failed its Constitution save as one that it succeeded for the purposes of recovery.
  - More powerful magic can cure the disease as normal.
