# House Tharask (Mark of Finding)

Leader

- The Triumvirate (Maagrim Torrn, Khandar'aashta, and Daric Velderan)

Headquarters

- Zarash'ak, Shadow Marches

House Tharashk traditionally licenses inquisitives and bounty hunters. Recently the house's Finder's Guild has expanded into dragonshard prospecting. As dragon­shards are the lifeblood of the magical economy, the house's talent has given them new wealth and influence.

Tharashk is the youngest of the dragonmarked houses and hasn't embraced all the customs of the others. The distinct clans that united to form the house remain important, and heirs of the family usually retain their family names rather than adopting "d'Tharashk" as tradition dictates. Each of the three major clans—the Aashta, the Torrn, and the Velderan—has a representative on the Triumvirate that governs the house, and the city of Zarash'ak in the Shadow Marches. Together, they stand as one under the emblem of the dragonne (a lion-dragon hybrid).
