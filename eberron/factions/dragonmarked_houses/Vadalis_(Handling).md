# House Vadalis (Mark of Handling)

Leader

- Dalin d'Vadalis

Headquarters

- Foalswood (near Varna, Eldeen Reaches)

Represented by the hippogriff, House Vadalis plays an important role in daily life, offering meat, mounts, and more. Vadalis isn't one of the most powerful houses, but its barons are generally content; they're more interested in discovering new monstrosities than engaging in politics. The current head of the house, Dalin d'Vadalis, disdains the use of a title and has no aspirations to nobility or greatness for himself or his house.

House Vadalis breeds and trains beasts for a wide range of purposes. While the house maintains vast cattle ranches and trains horses and hounds, the Mark of Handling allows Vadalis to work with more exotic creatures as well. Griffons, hippogriffs, and even bulettes can be bred and trained. Even with the Mark of Handling, this is dangerous work; there's a lot of turnover at the bulette ranch. But these exotic creatures aren't enough to satisfy the most innovative members of the house, leading to the practice of magebreeding. Using dragonshard focus items, Vadalis has found ways to create magical creatures. Typically, this results in a superior version of a creatureâ€”an animal that is stronger, faster, and smarter. But rumors claim that Vadalis has crafted monsters of its own. Some rumors even insist that Vadalis is trying to magebreed better humans.
