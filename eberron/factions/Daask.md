# Daask

Formed by monstrous immigrants from Droaam, Daask has been building its power in the Khyber’s Gate and Malleon’s Gate districts of Sharn for the last decade. It is most infamous for its monstrous enforcers, but the organization also draws members from the destitute populace of Sharn—largely goblins and shifters, but also humans, dwarves, and any other humanoid who feels that the current system has failed them. Daask makes its money through acts of violence, from mugging to armed robbery to outright pillaging. The group has diversified in recent years, building an extortion racket—threatening violence if tribute isn’t paid—and entering into the drug trade, selling both dreamlily and a mysterious substance called dragon’s blood.

From the outside, Daask appears to be interested solely in fomenting violence and chaos. The monstrous nature of its members reinforces this impression; most people consider the members of Daask to be savage beasts. The truth is more complicated. The Droaamites who make up the core of Daask aren’t merely criminals; they are elite soldiers of Droaam working for Sora Katra, and part of an operation that is taking root in larger cities across Khorvaire. The seemingly random attacks by Daask are part of a larger plan that, if it succeeds, will eventually give Sora Katra a foothold in the heart of Khorvaire.

Over the last two years, the Daask cell in Sharn has been waging a slowly escalating war against the holdings of the Boromar Clan. The Boromars were surprised by the violence of these attacks and have suffered significant losses. Daask prefers guerrilla tactics, using only as many combatants as necessary to get a job done, never staying in one place too long, and quickly retreating back to their turf. Though the Boromars still control much of criminal activity in the middle and upper parts of Sharn, Daask is gaining ground in the lower level of the city and controls crime in the Cogs.

## Operations

Violence and intimidation are Daask's most used tools. Rather than using bribery, Daask manipulates the Sharn Watch through displays of force and brutal reprisals against officers who dare to stand in the way. Coupled with the fact that Daask primarily targets businesses with ties to the Boromars, this means that many of the Watch officers of the lower wards will step aside and allow a Daask raid to run its course.

As Daask has seized territory from the Boromar Clan, it has also begun taking over a few of the clan’s traditional businesses. In addition to dreamlily, Daask sells a highly addictive drug called dragon’s blood.

Daask has another, perhaps surprising area of operation: religion. The organization has brought priests of the Dark Six to Sharn and has restored a ruined temple to the Dark Six in Khyber’s Gate. Followers of the Dark Six have few other opportunities to practice their faith, and providing this new facility for them has made many allies for Daask across the city.
