# Undying Court

- Our greatest champions and sages will never be lost to us. Their wisdom guides us, and their power protects us all.
- Honor our past. Respect our traditions. Perfect your skills and you may earn your place among the Deathless.
- Destroy those foul creatures that channel the power of Mabar, for they consume the essence of our world.

The elves of Aerenal refuse to let their greatest souls be lost to the oblivion that is Dolurrh. The wisest and most accomplished elves are preserved after death, becoming members of the Undying Court. The devotion of the living elves sustains the Undying Court, and the Court generates a well of mystic energy that empowers their clerics. As an Aereni cleric, your spells aren't personally granted to you by a specific Undying Councilor. Your powers flow from the Court itself, allowing you to serve its will and to protect your people.

Of all the religions of Eberron, the Undying Court is most grounded in the world. The Court stands in the city of Shae Mordai, and as an Aerenal elf, you could seek an audience with one of your deathless ancestors. As a devotee of the Undying Court, you recognize it as the power that sustains your civilization and as an assembly of your greatest sages and leaders. Should you accomplish great achievements in your life, you can aspire to join the Court.

As a cleric or paladin of the Undying Court, you have a concrete relationship with your deity. In creating your character, consider why you've traveled so far from home. Are you on a specific mission? Are you serving the Court as a whole, or are you acting as an agent of a specific councilor—perhaps your own ancestor? The Undying Court despises undead creatures that prey on the living, so if you don't have a concrete mission, you can always hunt down undead and evil necromancers.

## Symbol

The symbol of the Undying Court is a golden mask with luminous eyes, worn over the face while a priest is carrying out their duties. Devotees wear a smaller mask as a brooch or amulet.

## Rites

The most sacred rite of the Undying Court is trance communion. While in trance, an Aereni elf engages in meditation that connects them to the gestalt consciousness of the Court. This experience affirms the place of the individual as part of the greater whole. Since trance communion is a personal experience, the role of the priest is to provide spiritual and practical guidance to their congregation. A masked priest serves as the face of the Court, and any elf can approach them seeking an ease to their burdens.

## Temples

In Aerenal, the temples of the Undying Court are step pyramids built from stone. In Khorvaire, shrines to the Court use imported Aereni densewood, a particularly tough lumber that grows only on the island. Regardless of form, the walls are engraved with stories about the Undying Councilors that serve as the particular patrons of the temple, usually those related to the local priests.
