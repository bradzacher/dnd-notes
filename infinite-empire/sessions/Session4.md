# Session 4 - Monday October 12th 2020

- The plan:
  - Looks
    - Disguise Spell on Nairo and Dimas
    - Disguise Kit on Hector and Retha
    - Griby to wildshape into a tiny animal
  - Plan
    - Get to the Chairman and try and get the key
      - Use the sleep apple if we need
    - Get to the vault and infiltrate
  - Apple sauce is the safe word if we need to leave

IT ALL WENT TO SHIT

- It was glorious
- We infiltrated successfully
- Horse motifs everywhere
- Portraits of people with red hair wearing pelts
  - different to the horse motifs, unsure why
- Got the key from the chairman without issue
- Got to the vault without issue
- Opened the vault fine
- Vault contained a magical detection system
- Guards were alerted and combat ensued
- We got the gems
- There was a giant golem in the vault?!?
  - It chased us for quite some time
- We barely got away safely
