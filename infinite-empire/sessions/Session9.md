# Session 9 - Monday November 17th 2020

- At the temple
  - We met [[Thessalar]]
    - He's strong.
    - To save our lives we agreed to go steal the gem skull plans from [[Moghadam]].
    - Thessalar said Moghadam won't pay us and is shit.
    - He called the temple "the eye"
  - Shimmery blue robe mage Ard-Sagart
- Back at the tomb
  - [[Moghadam]] tried to kill us!! Rude.
  - We killed him.
    - Maybe? His brain teleported away or something
  - We found in his room:
    - 1x adamantine breastplate
    - 3x scrolls
    - 1x wand (unidentified)
    - 1x forgery kit
    - 1x calligraphy kit
    - 30pp
    - Ledger listing payments to the dark dwarves
