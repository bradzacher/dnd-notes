# Session 3 - Monday October 5th 2020

- Nairoladnam and Retha tried to get some information on Lynx and Ursas, but weren't able to get much.
- Nairo went to scout out
  - Sir Ursus
    - Single guard standing out front.
    - Guards rotating every 2 hours - smartly dressed but bulky.
    - The grounds are surrounded by a hedge maze
      - Clearly enchanted - easy to get lost in, impossible to climb out of
      - Nairo got lost...
      - [[Sir Ursas]] saved her.
        - He magically finds his way through
- We went to talk to [[Sir Ursus]] in the morning.
  - He wanted the gems
    - Sad we returned them to the librarians.
    - He said the gems shouldn't exist, but do due to the magic of the fey wild.
    - Believes gems are part of an ancient machine.
    - Machine would give him great power.
      - Power he would use to fight for the people and win the war he lost (the pacification war)
      - He fought against the emperor.
      - Knows of an ancient **_TEMPLE_** that contains part of the machine
        - Certain the gems can help him find the entire machine.
  - He was not aware his man had been killed.
    - Does not know who [[Kalarel the Vile]] is.
  - His quest:
    - Help him find the machine and use it to free the people.
- We went to visit [[Lynx Creatlach]] for tea.
  - Same spiel about the machine
  - She instead mentions a **_TOMB_**.
  - She lies about her love for the emperor.
  - She wants to put down the evil that takes away freedoms.
  - She has a fake eye (it's magical?)
- [[Mr Happy Joy]]
  - A gnome was waiting for us outside our inn.
    - "Boss wants to speak to you about Spike"
  - Tradesman's district
  - He was the one that contracted the librarians for the gems
  - He wants us to steal them or fight for them to retrieve them
  - He was hired by the Syndicate
    - He wants to please them to gain nobility
  - He's offering us 12,000gp to get the gems from the librarians by any means
    - Gems are held at a "neutral" bank that he's found out about
      - Bank of House Khaal
